  "Title": "Let There Be Rock 2",
  "Description": "This album came screaming out of Australia in 1977! AC/DC's first stab at a \"real\" album - a break from the early \"novelty\" approach to songwriting and a move to the more focused album-oriented view that the band would perfect.\r\n\r\nLet There Be Rock, the fourth AC/DC album -- and first to see simultaneous international release -- is as lean and mean as the original lineup ever got. Shaved down to the bone -- there are only eight tracks, giving this a lethal efficiency even with a couple of meandering jams -- this is a high-voltage, brutal record, filled with \"Bad Boy Boogie.\" It has a bit of a bluesier edge than other AC/DC records, but this is truly the sound of the band reaching its peak. There's the near majesty of \"Let There Be Rock,\" there's Bon Scott acknowledging with a wink that \"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be,\" and then there's the monumental \"Whole Lotta Rosie.\" Which gets down to a key thing about AC/DC. If Led Zeppelin were celebrating a \"Whole Lotta Love,\" AC/DC got down to the grimy details in their leering tribute to the joys of sex with a plus-sized woman. And that's AC/DC's allure in a nutshell -- it's sweaty, dirty, nasty rock, music that is played to the last call and beyond, and they've rarely done that kind of rock better than they did here.",

In its own way, it was a reaction against the pompous art rock and lumbering arena rock of the early '70s. AC/DC's rock was minimalist -- no matter how huge and bludgeoning their guitar chords were, there was a clear sense of space and restraint. Combined with Bon Scott's larynx-shredding vocals, the band spawned countless imitators over the next two decades and enjoyed commercial success well into the 2000s.",

  "Description": "Technically, Mercyful Fate's debut LP is slightly patchy and derivative, particularly of early Black Sabbath and Judas Priest, although in parts it is more ambitious than those bands' major works, in a `proggy' kind of way. It also sounds a bit dated in parts. In terms of originality, craftsmanship, instrumental prowess, and King Diamond's application of his unique and controversial voice and vocal range, it was comprehensively surpassed by Diamond's later solo classics (particularly Them, Conspiracy, and The Eye), and even by Mercyful Fate's 1993 reunion album, In The Shadows (although I prefer the more dynamic rhythm section on Melissa than those on The Eye or In The Shadows).\r\nWhat puts this album in a supreme league of its own is a wickedly powerful aura that builds up throughout the album, which is something that no amount of musica training can achieve, and no review can adequately reflect. Reviewer 'stevex3' gives us a taste when he says 'I'm sure that this CD gets played at every gathering of demons, but you really cannot have any idea what that means unless you experience this album for yourself (preferably played loud in the dark), as different people will experience it differently, and will undoubtedly have a hard time explaining their experience.",

    "Description": "Arguably the most original and critically acclaimed group to come from Denmark was Mercyful Fate. Mercyful Fate's nucleus comprised of the multi-octave vocals of King Diamond aka Kim Bendix Petersen, and the twin lead guitar attack of Hank Sherman aka Rene Krolmark and Michael Denner. 'Melissa' was the group's first formal recording and was a featured LP for Road Runner Records. Although 'Melissa' was originally released in 1983, and re-released in 1997, Roadrunner Records has remastered the songs and released this classic for your listening enjoyment. It includes the highly sought after early 1980's BBC sessions, two extra demo tracks of 'Black Funeral', and 'Curse of the Pharaohs' and a three track DVD featuring live footage of the band during early 1983. A commentary by King Diamond himself narrates the performance and the story of the group during that time frame. Mercyful Fate pioneered a sub genre of ultra heavy and complex music renown for its macabre lyrics, and Satanic/occultism driven imagery and attitude called Black Metal.",

And now that I've pigeonholed this CD to death, I'll move on to the music. Corrosion Of Conformity serves up some unforgiving, politically motivated anger with Blind. The guitar tone has a punishing crunch that has been hard to parallel in my mind. With the bass pushing that crunch, this is one heavy listen... I love it! Nothing will guarantee you a speeding ticket quicker than 'Dance Of The Dead' or 'Mine Are The Eyes Of God'. 'Vote With A Bullet' spells out COC's political views very clearly, and also manages to wrap it up in one awesome tune! Even the slowest song on the CD, 'Echoes In The Well', manages to churn out some dark and brooding overtones. Every single song on here is heavy and uncompromising. The lyrics are very poignant and intelligent. Amidst so many bands who, lately like to pose as revolutionary, Corrosion Of Conformity take a shot at 'The Man' that is, without dispute, the most real and profound yet. A lot of bands have come and gone, taking some inspiration from Corrosion Of Conformity, yet these guys continue to go on (granted under a different style).
