        "Description": "Motörhead are the founding fathers of speed and thrash metal. Without this band, there would be no Slayer or Sepultura, so you've at least got to give Lemmy and Co. props for being so influential. And \"Aces of Spades\" is an essential, legendary speed metal classic. It's full of fast, meaty riffs, great solos, toe-tapping drums, and catchy, gruff vocals. Almost every song on here (especially the title track, \"Love Me Like a Reptile,\" and \"We Are The Road Crew\") is very catchy. And the album opening title track, which has a speedy, groove-y main riff, is world renowned. Other highlights include the wah-wah solo and shout-along refrain on \"Fire, Fire,\" \"Jailbait,\" \"Dance\" (which has a pair of tasty guitar solos), the X-rated \"The Chase Is Better Than The Catch,\" and the famous, rhythmic, nearly dance-able \"Please Don't Touch.\" All in all, if you're looking for great, groove-y, contagious and exciting speed metal, Motorhead \"aces\" it.",

        "Description": "Act III  is the third studio album by the thrash metal band Death Angel, released in 1990 on Geffen Records. Regarded by many critics and fans as the band's finest effort, the album was produced by famed metal producer Max Norman (Ozzy Osbourne, Megadeth, Loudness), and marked the first (and only) major label release by Death Angel. The album spawned the singles \"Seemingly Endless Time\" and \"A Room with a View\", with both songs receiving music videos and airplay on MTV's Headbangers Ball. Songs like \"Discontinued\" incorporate elements of funk.\n\n@icon-warning On tour in support of Act III in 1991, the band suffered a serious tour **bus crash** in which drummer Andy Galeon was critically injured. During his yearlong recovery, singer Mark Osegueda left the band, effectively ending Death Angel. In 2001, the band reunited for Testament singer Chuck Billy's Thrash of the Titans benefit concert (minus Gus Pepa) and went on to release The Art of Dying in 2004, followed by three more albums.",

Death Angel has released seven studio albums, two demo tapes, one box set and two live albums.\r\n\r\nTwo independent releases, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), attracted the attention of Geffen Records, which signed the quintet in 1989 and released their next album, Act III, one year later. While Death Angel was touring in support of Act III, drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and needed more than a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy. The band continues to record and perform today.",

Rather like Metallica circa ...And Justice for All, the sound is focused heavily on texture, with vocals and guitars layered one atop the other, and heart-pounding drums underlying everything. There's not a whole lot of variety on Tool's second full-length album--most of the songs start off fairly low-key, kicking into high gear for the chorus, and repeat--but Maynard James Keenan's distinctive voice, the prog-rock stylings over a heavy metal base, and a supremely unhealthy dose of vitriol make this the perfect album to bang your head to.",

            "Description": "Tool's greatest breakthrough was to meld dark underground metal with the ambition of art rock. Although Metallica wrote their multi-sectioned, layered songs as if they were composers, they kept their musical attack ferociously at street level. Tool didn't. They embraced the artsy, bohemian preoccupations of Jane's Addiction while they simultaneously paid musical homage to the relentlessly bleak visions of grindcore, death metal, and thrash. Even with their post-punk influences, they executed their music with the aesthetic of prog rock, alternating between long, detailed instrumental interludes and lyrical rants in their songs.\r\n\r\nUndertowTool had a knack for conveying the strangled, oppressive angst that the alternative nation of the early '90s claimed as its own. So, Tool were able to slip into the definition of alternative rock during the post-Nirvana era, landing a slot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993, which helped their first full-length debut album, Undertow, rocket to platinum status. By the time the band delivered its belated follow-up, Ænima, in 1996, alternative rock had lost its grip on the mainstream of America, and Tool's audience had shaped up as essentially metal-oriented, which meant that the group and the record didn't capture as big an audience as their first album, despite debuting at number two on the charts. After a co-headlining slot with Korn on Lollapalooza '97 wrapped up, Tool remained on the road, supporting Ænima until well into the next year.",

The second two-disc installment of THE ALCHEMY INDEX answers VOLS. 1 & 2 (FIRE & WATER) from the first set with VOLS. 3 & 4 (EARTH & AIR). There’s little evidence of the ferocious screamo aesthetic that characterized releases like THE ILLUSION OF SAFETY; instead AIR & EARTH ventures into mostly acoustic, highly melodic territory. The tight, technically complex instrumental prowess of the band is still on display, but the mood is much more atmospheric. The songs veer from ethereal and psychedelic to a more conventional folk or singer-songwriter vein (this is especially true of the tracks on the EARTH disc), but the whole adds up to an impressive, original showing from one of the genre’s innovators.",

The group was founded by guitarist/vocalist Dustin Kensrue and guitarist Teppei Teranishi while they were in high school.[1]\r\n\r\nEarly in their career, the band was known for fast, hard music based in heavily distorted guitars, prominent lead guitar lines, and frequent changes in complex time signatures.[2] This style is exemplified on their second album, The Illusion of Safety (2002) and their third album The Artist in the Ambulance (2003). Their fourth album Vheissu (2005) made significant changes by incorporating electronic beats, keyboards, and more experimental and nuanced songwriting.[3][4] Their fifth effort was a double album entitled The Alchemy Index (2007/2008), released as two sets of two CDs that together make a 4-part, 24-song cycle. Each of the four 6-song EPs of the Alchemy Index features significantly different styles, based on different aspects of the band's musical aesthetic which reflect the elemental themes of fire, water, air and earth, both lyrically and musically.[5] The band's sixth album, entitled Beggars, was released on August 11, 2009, and their seventh, Major/Minor on September 20, 2011. The most recent albums feature a refined combination of the band's different experiments and explorations.",

            "Description": "Attitude Adjustment is a crossover thrash band originally formed in the early 1980s in the San Francisco Bay Area.\r\n\r\nThe band was formed by Chris Kontos, Eric Smith and Rick Strahl in early 1985, with Nick Koljian briefly on vocals. The lineup was changed with the addition of Kevin Reed on vocals. This lineup played a number of initial shows at Ruthies Inn, the New Method, the Mabuhay Gardens and other Bay Area venues. Several months later, Kevin Reed was replaced by Andy Andersen on vocals and Chris Scapparo joined as a second guitarist. They shortly went into the studio to record the \"Dead Serious Demo\" in 1985. The demo was recorded at Peter Miller Studios and engineered by Eric Kauschen.\r\n\r\nIn 1986 and 1987, Attitude Adjustment played frequent gigs throughout California. They played alongside bands like Forbidden (Known as Forbidden Evil at that time), Vio-Lence, Sacrilege, Possessed, Hirax, Death Angel, R.K.L., Dr. Know, Suicidal Tendencies, Corrosion of Conformity, D.R.I., Discharge, UK Subs, Neurosis, The Exploited and Operation Ivy, among others. The band finally released their debut album, American Paranoia released by Pusmort Records. This album is considered to be a \"crossover\" between hardcore and thrash metal and was one of the first in this genre.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1987, Andy Andersen, Chris Scaparro and Rick Strahl joined up with former Condemned to Death guitarist Keith Chatham, to form Condemned Attitude, which would later be renamed Attitude.\r\n\r\nAttitude released an LP and an EP, taking a more thrash metal-like style, with Andy Andersen returning to his initial style of singing. Rick Strahl and Chris Scaparro became the new guitarists with Eric Brecht (formerly of DRI) on drums during this time.\r\n\r\nChris Kontos, Eric Smith and Kevin Reed continued on with Attitude Adjustment and in 1988, this new lineup released the EP No More Mr. Nice Guy, again on Pusmort Records, which is very different from American Paranoia.\r\n\r\nBy 1990, former members Andy Anderson, Chris Scaparro, and Rick Strahl formed a new band with a more hard rock direction. The band was called Two Bit Thief and they kept it alive until 1995.\r\n\r\nKontos and Reed returned to the name \"Attitude Adjustment\" in 1991, but with another new lineup to record their last studio album, Out Of Hand, again mixing hardcore with thrash metal. In 1993, the American Paranoia LP and the No More Mr. Nice Guy EP were re-issued on CD. The LP version includes the \"Dead Serious\" demo.\r\n\r\nChris Kontos joined Robb Flynn (who left Vio-Lence) in 1993 to form the post thrash band Machine Head.",

Albums like this speak to the fifteen year-old in us that gets tired of turning on the radio and hearing only prefabricated crap. 13 years after first hearing this album, and owning it both as cassette and CD, I'm proud to say I still enjoy it.\r\n\r\nWhat isn't to like about it? Out of The Big Four ( Anthrax, Magadeth, Metallica, and Slayer), Anthrax possibly had the best singer. Joey Belladonna, silly hairdo and all, had a tremendous voice. The guitar team of Scott Ian and Dan Spitz was bulletproof. Spitz was possibly the most underrated lead guitarist in all of heavy metal. He sounded like nobody else. Ian deserves a place in the pantheon of great rhythm guitarists. The uncle-nephew rhythm section of Charlie Benante and Frank Bello is unforgettable. Benante had to have been hiding two or three extra arms somewhere. And last but not least, Bello played without a pick like all real bassists. Plus he played FAST.\r\nAnd finally, Anthrax showed the greatest imagination and diversity with their lyrics on this album. \"I Am the Law\" is about Judge Dredd. \"Among the Living\" and \"A Skeleton in the Closet\" are based on Stephen King's work. \"N.F.L.\" is about a fallen comedian, either Lenny Bruce or John Belushi I think. The arms race, particularly under Reagan, was attacked in \"One World\". And who can forget the anti-racism classic \"Indians\"? The lyrics were written by juveniles on ATL. Smart juveniles.",

            "Description": "One of the first punk-metal fusion bands, Corrosion of Conformity were formed in North Carolina by guitarist Woody Weatherman during the early '80s. In their early years, C.O.C. became known for their aggressive sound, intelligent political lyrics, and willingness to break away from both hardcore and metal conventions. In the '90s, their shift to a more stripped-down, deliberate sound -- sort of Black Sabbath filtered through the Deep South -- brought them enough in line with the alt metal Zeitgeist to bring them a measure of mainstream popularity. Then recently they turned back to their hardcore roots with ther 2012 and 2014 releases that mixes the raw",

Although the band has hard-core roots, this incarnation of members from Attitude Adjustment, Attitude, DRI and Condemned played more straight forward rock with a hard edge and stinging social street lyrics. The band had a unique style that wasn't terribly original, but in its own way provided likable and authentic rock music. Two Bit's shows were always entertaining as the band continued its frentic stage shows from the punk rock days.\r\n\r\nThe band produced 3 albums with varying line ups the first of which was Another Sad Story in the big city which is the most polished of the bunch. It's mostly a straight forward rock affair that is a fun listen. Gangster Rebel Bop turns to a lighter more playful style that also is more bluesy and show-cases some fine song writing and guitar riffs for genuinely memorable songs. Unforutnately for the band the line-up changes and lack of label support resulted in this deserving band not getting much attention and sinking into obscurity.",

            "Description": "When Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, the band's future was put into question. Within months rumors flew that ex-Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell would replace de la Rocha. And gossip fueled truth, for Cornell joined the rest of Rage in the studio in May 2001. The mix was great and a musical bond was in the making: Cornell, Tim Commerford, Brad Wilk, and Tom Morello spent the next year writing and recording. By spring 2002, the foursome were no longer going by the Rage Against the Machine name and signed on for Ozzfest. But before the summer tour even got underway, Cornell quit the new project. \r\nHe claimed it wasn't moving forward in the direction he'd hoped for. The breakdown didn't last, for Cornell rejoined by early fall. After tossing around the idea of being called Civilian, they settled on Audioslave. The single \"Cochise,\" named for the great American Indian chief who died free and unconquered, hit radio in September 2002, and Audioslave's Epic full-length debut was released that November. The self-titled album eventually went multi-platinum on the strength of \"Cochise\" and the moody rocker \"Like a Stone,\" and Audioslave supported it with gigs that included 2003 Lollapalooza dates. Cornell, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford returned in May 2005 with Out of Exile, which debuted at number one on Billboard. That same month they played an historic show in Havana, Cuba, that marked that country's first outdoor show by an American rock band (that fall releasing the whole shebang on the Live in Cuba DVD). Exile continued the band's platinum-selling ways -- singles like \"Be Yourself\" and \"Doesn't Remind Me\" went to the top of the charts -- and the guys wasted no time following up with album number three, Revelations, in early September 2006. Work on the album took only five weeks, since most of the songs had been fleshed out live over the previous year. In 2007, shortly after the members of Rage announced that they would reunite for that year's Coachella festival, Cornell left Audioslave, citing both personal and musical differences, and leaving the state of Audioslave uncertain.",

            "Description": "Noted for their irreverent style and tough but hooky tunes, German punk/metal band Die Toten Hosen are one of Germany's most successful rock bands, still commanding a large and loyal following at home and in Australia, South America, and Japan more than three decades after they began. Die Toten Hosen (the name literally translates as \"the Dead Trousers\") was formed in 1982 from the ashes of two Düsseldorf punk bands, ZK and KFC. Considering that three members of the Hosen were named Andreas, they took stage names to avoid confusion: vocalist Campino (b. Andreas Frege; June 22, 1962), guitarist Breiti (b. Andreas Breitkopf; Feb. 6, 1964), rhythm guitarist Kuddel (b. Andreas Von Holst; June 11, 1964), bassist Andi (b. Andreas Meurer; July 24, 1962), and drummer Trini (b. Klaus-Dieter Trimpop; June 10, 1951). Die Toten Hosen self-released their first album, Opel Gang, in 1983, and several months later, EMI signed the group and reissued the LP. EMI soon grew disenchanted with the band (particularly after they were sued by German pop icon Heino after they parodied him in concert), and Virgin released their next album, Unter Falscher Flagge, in 1984; the following year, Trini vacated the drum stool to become the group's manager, and Wölli (b. Wolfgang Rohde; Jan. 9, 1963) took over on percussion. In 1986, the band released Damenwahl, which fared well on the charts and gave them their first taste of corporate sponsorship -- Fromms, a major condom manufacturer, helped promote the Damenwahl tour and provided samples of their products to hand out to fans. A live album followed, 1987's Bis Zum Bitteren Ende, and the group finally moved from cult favorites to a real commercial force in Germany with 1988's Ein Kleines Bisschen Horrorschau, which rose to number seven on the German charts.",

Led by the unique vocal stylings of screeching banshee Udo Dirkschneider, the band forged an instantly recognizable sound and was notorious as one of the decade's fiercest live acts. Despite recording two of the best heavy metal albums of the decade in Restless & Wild and Balls to the Wall, Accept remained too heavy and extreme for American audiences to embrace -- even when they tried to tone down their act with more melodic songs. Ultimately having conquered the rest of the world, but with their career stalled in the U.S., Accept fell apart, but reunited years later to confront a radically changed music marketplace.",

            "Description": "Rage Against the Machine, commonly abbreviated as RATM, is an American rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of rapper/vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk. They draw inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as hip hop acts such as Afrika Bambaataa,[1] Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and Dutch crossover band Urban Dance Squad.[2] Rage Against the Machine is best known for its leftist political views, which are expressed in many of its songs. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide.[3]\r\n\r\nIn 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band's third album, The Battle of Los Angeles, followed in 1999, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history, according to music journalist Colin Devenish.[4] They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which emerged during the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, the band released the cover album, Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over the direction of the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup. De la Rocha started a low-key solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Up until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. As of 2014, the group has no plans to record new material.[5]",

Vocalist Klaus Meine had a throat operation prior to the record's release, and surprisingly, his voice sounds more melodic and lively than ever. The rest of the band sounds great as well, and the album is highlighted by the fast-paced performances of guitarists Rudolf Schenker and Matthias Jabs. Blackout has arguably been called the Scorpions' best record ever, and that statement is not unjust -- it has more energy than anything else they have ever released.",

And now that I've pigeonholed this CD to death, I'll move on to the music. Corrosion Of Conformity serves up some unforgiving, politically motivated anger with Blind. The guitar tone has a punishing crunch that has been hard to parallel in my mind. With the bass pushing that crunch, this is one heavy listen... I love it! Nothing will guarantee you a speeding ticket quicker than 'Dance Of The Dead' or 'Mine Are The Eyes Of God'. 'Vote With A Bullet' spells out COC's political views very clearly, and also manages to wrap it up in one awesome tune! Even the slowest song on the CD, 'Echoes In The Well', manages to churn out some dark and brooding overtones. Every single song on here is heavy and uncompromising. The lyrics are very poignant and intelligent. Amidst so many bands who, lately like to pose as revolutionary, Corrosion Of Conformity take a shot at 'The Man' that is, without dispute, the most real and profound yet. A lot of bands have come and gone, taking some inspiration from Corrosion Of Conformity, yet these guys continue to go on (granted under a different style). This CD represents the high point of their songwriting and musical career.",

Producer Chris Goss masterfully captures the band's unique heavy/light formula, which becomes apparent as soon as the gentle but sinister intro melody gives way to the chugging main riff in the opener, \"Thumb.\" This segues immediately into the galloping \"Green Machine,\" which pummels forward inexorably and even features that rarest rock & roll moment: a bass solo. \"Thong Song\" alternates rumbling guitar explosions with almost complete silence, and \"Mondo Generator\" plays like an extended acid trip. The slow build of the epic \"Freedom Run\" and the driving \"Allen's Wrench\" are also highlights, and though the album is heavy on instrumentals, these actually provide a seamless transition from song to song.",

            "Description": "nce the kings of the Bay Area metal scene -- the birthplace of thrash -- Exodus were unceremoniously demoted from their post with the arrival of Los Angeles' Metallica in 1982. And while they proceeded to eke out a hit-and-miss career of their own over the next few decades, all the while influencing at least two separate generations of younger thrash bands, Exodus were ultimately fated to be the ultimate also-rans of the genre they helped spawn.\r\n\r\nFormed in 1981 by singer Paul Baloff, guitarists Gary Holt and Kirk Hammett, bassist Geoff Andrews, and drummer Tom Hunting, Exodus were heavily influenced by Motörhead and New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands like Iron Maiden and Raven, whose lessons they combined with the raw, D.I.Y. aesthetic of the prolific Bay Area punk scene to create thrash metal. Their handful of demos recorded between 1982-1984 became wildly popular on the all-important underground tape-trading circuit of the time, and solidified the band's standing as the Bay Area's first thrash champions. But they would soon lose their numero uno standing as well as their guitarist Hammett to the aforementioned Metallica, who then raced ahead of all competitors in their mission to bring thrash to the world. Wounded but undaunted, Exodus drafted guitarist Rick Hunolt and replaced bassist Andrews with Rob McKillop before signing with Torrid Records, for whom they recorded their Bonded by Blood debut in 1984. But the album languished unreleased for over a year due to business problems, and by the time it was finally unveiled by Combat Records in 1985, the would-be genre benchmark already sounded dated and its impact was severely dulled by the quick evolution of their peers.\r\n\r\nThese hardships also led to the ousting of vocalist Baloff, whose carefree, larger-than-life attitude (and often drunken behavior) made him an easy scapegoat for his more driven bandmates. His replacement was ex-Testament singer Steve \"Zetro\" Souza, who arrived in time for 1987's disappointing Pleasures of the Flesh -- an inconsistent album which did nothing to advance Exodus' cause. Incessant touring served to strengthen the band's new lineup, though, and 1989's meticulously conceived Fabulous Disaster was a critical triumph, bringing the group to their commercial peak. The successful world tour which followed brought another dramatic setback, however, when drummer Hunting was diagnosed with an irregular heartbeat which first sidelined, then forced him to quit the band at tour's end. Still, Exodus was on a roll, and their momentum led to a new contract with Capitol Records, which immediately rushed them back into the studio with former Anthrax drum tech John Tempesta manning the skins, to lay down tracks for 1990's Impact Is Imminent. But the absence of a competent producer and a carelessly assembled collection of songs resulted in a dull, forgettable album that was doomed to commercial failure from day one, squandering the group's recent accomplishments and pretty much closing their window to success. Longtime bassist McKillop left soon after (replaced by Mike Butler) and despite the renewed quality of 1992's Force of Habit (certainly their most diverse album ever), the members of Exodus decided to go their separate ways when the grunge revolution sidelined heavy metal bands of most any stripe.",

A follow-up EP on Sound King Records, My Love Is Bold (1999), garnered airplay on Canadian hard rock radio, setting the stage for I'm Alive and on Fire (2001), a 13-track compilation of the band's recording output from 1996 to 1999.",

            "Description": "With their brutal, simple riffs and aggressive, fast tempos, Accept were one of the top metal bands of the early '80s, and a major influence on the development of thrash. Led by the unique vocal stylings of screeching banshee Udo Dirkschneider, the band forged an instantly recognizable sound and was notorious as one of the decade's fiercest live acts. Despite recording two of the best heavy metal albums of the decade in Restless & Wild and Balls to the Wall, Accept remained too heavy and extreme for American audiences to embrace -- even when they tried to tone down their act with more melodic songs. Ultimately having conquered the rest of the world, but with their career stalled in the U.S., Accept fell apart, but reunited years later to confront a radically changed music marketplace.",

Though British Steel sounds dated these days, it's also a classic slice of metal, one of the best from a band that defined the genre in the late '70s and early '80s. Everything that ultimately became characteristic of heavy metal is here, from the lightning-fast riffs on \"Rapid Fire,\" the anthemic \"Metal Gods,\" and \"United\" to the obligatory party song \"Living After Midnight\" to the equally obligatory youth-rebellion song, \"You Don't Have to Be Old to Be Wise.\" British Steel is unquestionably Priest at their peak. The 2001 remastered reissue includes two bonus tracks--a previously unavailable studio selection called \"Red, White & Blue\" and a live take on \"Grinder.\"",

            "Description": "Judas Priest was one of the most influential heavy metal bands of the '70s, spearheading the New Wave of British Heavy Metal late in the decade. Decked out in leather and chains, the band fused the gothic doom of Black Sabbath with the riffs and speed of Led Zeppelin, as well as adding a vicious two-lead guitar attack; in doing so, they set the pace for much popular heavy metal from 1975 until 1985, as well as laying the groundwork for the speed and death metal of the '80s.\r\n\r\nFormed in Birmingham, England, in 1970, the group's core members were guitarist K.K. Downing and bassist Ian Hill. Joined by Alan Atkins and drummer John Ellis, the band played their first concert in 1971. Atkins' previous band was called Judas Priest, yet the members decided it was the best name for the new group. The band played numerous shows throughout 1971; during the year, Ellis was replaced by Alan Moore; by the end of the year, Chris Campbell replaced Moore. After a solid year of touring the U.K., Atkins and Campbell left the band in 1973 and were replaced by vocalist Rob Halford and drummer John Hinch. They continued touring, including a visit to Germany and the Netherlands in 1974. By the time the tour was completed, they had secured a record contract with Gull, an independent U.K. label. Before recording their debut album, Judas Priest added guitarist Glenn Tipton.\r\n\r\nRocka RollaRocka Rolla was released in September of 1974 to almost no attention. The following year, they gave a well-received performance at the Reading Festival and Hinch departed the band; he was replaced by Alan Moore. Later that year, the group released Sad Wings of Destiny, which earned some positive reviews. However, the lack of sales was putting the band in a dire financial situation, which was remedied by an international contract with CBS Records. Sin After Sin (1977) was the first album released under that contract; it was recorded with Simon Phillips, who replaced Moore. The record received positive reviews and the band departed for their first American tour, with Les Binks on drums.",

The current lineup of the band comprises Flynn, drummer Dave McClain, guitarist Phil Demmel, and bassist Jared MacEachern. Machine Head is one of the pioneering bands in the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.[5][6]\r\n\r\nMachine Head was formed by member Robb Flynn, previously part of the bands Forbidden and Vio-lence. Flynn felt musically unfulfilled with Vio-lence and requested to start a side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Adam Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine Head would not have success until later albums.\r\n\r\nThe band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label Roadrunner Records, when controversy surrounding Machine Head's fourth album Supercharger (released 3 weeks after September 11, 2001) resulted in their songs and music video for the song \"Crashing Around You\" (which featured burning buildings) being pulled from all media outlets. The band re-signed with Roadrunner soon after and has released four albums since, 2003's Through the Ashes of Empires, 2007's The Blackening (which earned Machine Head its first Grammy Award nomination) and 2011's Unto the Locust. Their most recent album, Bloodstone & Diamonds, was released in 2014. Machine Head have sold over 3 million records worldwide.[7]",

The album notably features cover art by Ed Repka, known for having created iconic covers for albums by Megadeth, Death and others. Extensive touring followed, along with a recording contract with Relapse Records. In addition to releasing the third Toxic Holocaust album, An Overdose of Death...

The leather-clad, hair-spiked foursome began recording for the Clay label in the early '80s, releasing some singles before unleashing their influential debut album, City Baby Attacked by Rats, in 1982. City Baby's Revenge followed two years later in 1984, by which time the band had become one of the leading punk metal bands of the era. G.B.H. continued recording and releasing albums throughout the '80s, though their influence progressively waned as a new wave of bands such as Slayer emerged and pushed punk metal toward what became known as speed metal and, in turn, thrash. Despite its waning influence, G.B.H. soldiered on, recording new albums throughout the '90s and into the next millennium. By this point the band was often cited by both metal and punk bands as a huge influence, and a renewed interest in G.B.H.'s early recordings resulted.",

            "Description": "Born-again crossover agents Condemned joined a long list of unlikely reunions mitigated by the Nuclear Blast label with 2011's Condemned 2 Death CD, their first release in almost two decades! You see, once upon a time in the mid-'80s, the San Francisco natives figured alongside D.R.I., the Dicks, M.D.C., and other fledgling groups in the now legendary Vat's scene, so there's no questioning Condemned's credentials -- just the wisdom of their return, should it go pear-shaped. Yet, by and large, those worries evaporate just as soon as Condemned 2 Death gets underway, launched by a Motörhead-like bassline from band lynchpin Keith Chatham on \"Big Time Game Hunting,\" which paves the way for a rarely surprising but consistently engaging and oftentimes euphoric collection of timeless hardcore anthems. Purists looking to simply pump their fists and shout along need look no further than infectious calls-to-arms like \"Aggressive System\" and \"Anti-Social\"; crossover fans looking to satisfy their metallic speed-riffing kinks can dive into \"Thoughts of Equality\" and \"Emotional Blurr\"; attention-deficit-disorder listeners will get just what they crave in sub-minute blasts like \"Practicing for War\" and \"D-Day\"; then everyone can catch their breath during slower numbers like \"Thoughts of Equality,\" \"Crucified,\" and \"Cleansing Pool.\" The lyrics, like the music, also stick with the classic hardcore program (socio-political messages, railing against the system, etc.), harking back to simpler times and familiar hallmarks rather than experimenting with new millennium chicanery. But one feels this is ultimately for the better, and the authentic results show Condemned validating their belated comeback by remembering where they come from, and their fans surely wouldn't want it any other way.",

            "Description": "\r\nAs part of the original punk rock movement in England during the mid-'70s, the U.K. Subs scored several hit singles in their homeland, switching between politically charged material and party-hearty rockers. Led by singer Charlie Harper (who previously fronted a R&B outfit called the Marauders), the U.K. Subs formed in November of 1976, after Harper discovered the Damned. Originally called the Subversives before shortening their name, Harper recruited guitarist Nicky Garratt, bassist Steve Slack, and a revolving door of drummers (eventually finding a semi-permanent member with Pete Davis), and soon after began plotting their plan of attack from Harper's place of business, a hairdressing salon in South London. Around this time, the up-and-coming group recorded a live set at the infamous punk club the Roxy (just prior to its closing), with hopes of the recording being issued as their debut album. Although the recording did indeed go down, the tapes sat on a shelf for several years, before eventually being issued in 1980 under the title of Live Kicks. This led to several John Peel sessions on BBC Radio One in 1977 and 1978, and eventually, a recording contract with the GEM record label, and what's often considered to be their finest recording, their 1979 full-length debut, Another Kind of Blues.\r\n\r\nThe group enjoyed success back home straight off the bat, as they had several moderate hit singles (\"Stranglehold,\" \"Tomorrow's Girls\"), appeared at the mammoth Glastonbury Festival, landed a cover story for Sounds magazine, and were even the subject of a Julien Temple-directed film documentary, entitled Punk Can Take It. \r\n\r\n1980 saw the U.K. Subs attempt to crack the U.S. market, with a few opening gigs for the Police, as a pair of studio albums were issued, Brand New Age and Crash Course. But as the public's interest began to shift from punk to new wave/synth pop in the early '80s, the U.K. Subs saw their popularity quickly begin to dwindle, as bandmembers began to come and go. The band continued on with such further releases as 1981's Diminished Responsibility and 1982's Endangered Species (among others), as the group's sound grew more and more a kin to hard rock/heavy metal. But despite almost all of the original U.K. punk groups going their separate ways by the early to mid-'80s (the Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Damned, etc.), the U.K. Subs never split up; although Harper was often the only original member left in attendance, the group continued to issue albums and never ceased playing shows. '80s-era bassist Alvin Gibbs would go on to briefly play bass for punk godfather Iggy Pop in 1988, and even penned a book about his experiences, Neighbourhood Threat: On Tour With Iggy Pop. The '90s saw the release of countless U.K. Subs \"hits\" collections, the best of the bunch being 1991's Singles 1978-1982 and 1996's The Punk Singles Collection.",

Most of the songs on the album are built on monolithic power chords which range from ferocious speed on \"Heaven's Not Overflowing\" and \"Senor Limpio\" to slower, groovier numbers such as \"Broken Man\" and leadoff single \"Albatross.\" Second single \"Clean My Wounds\" also struck gold at rock radio with its staccato riffing, and \"Seven Days\" adds eerie guitar melodies to the mix. On the downside, the plodding title track (featuring vocals from returning founding bassist Mike Dean) gets a little tedious around the sixth minute, and a number of faceless guitar instrumentals are interspersed through the album, really breaking up its rhythm.",

In the '90s, their shift to a more stripped-down, deliberate sound -- sort of Black Sabbath filtered through the Deep South -- brought them enough in line with the alt metal Zeitgeist to bring them a measure of mainstream popularity. Then recently they turned back to their hardcore roots with ther 2012 and 2014 releases that mixes the raw",

        "Description": "While Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap sounds like every other AC/DC album, it is distinguished by a lyrical puerility spectacular even by Bon Scott's standards. Two tracks--\"Love at First Feel\" and \"Squealer\"--are ruminations on the morality of sex with schoolgirls. \"Big Balls,\" ostensibly a narrative from the perspective of an aristocrat socialite, is actually a somewhat labored excuse for the band to chant \"We've got big balls.\" This juvenile posturing was, to a large degree, AC/DC winding up their burgeoning foreign audience by playing to stereotypical expectations of Australians. On Dirty Deeds, however, AC/DC try too hard. Only on \"Ain't No Fun (Waiting Round to Be a Millionaire)\" is Scott's laconic wit deployed to real effect: the sheer glee in the line \"Get your fuckin' jumbo jet off my airport!\" is almost worth the album's purchase price.",

In its own way, it was a reaction against the pompous art rock and lumbering arena rock of the early '70s. AC/DC's rock was minimalist -- no matter how huge and bludgeoning their guitar chords were, there was a clear sense of space and restraint. Combined with Bon Scott's larynx-shredding vocals, the band spawned countless imitators over the next two decades and enjoyed commercial success well into the 2000s.",

Loaded with satanic lyrics, incredibly complex guitar melodies, and King Diamond's eerie voice, \"Don't Break the Oath\" is one of the best albums to ever be found in black metal. \"A Dangerous Meeting\", \"Desecration of Souls\", \"The Oath\", and \"Come to the Sabbath\" are Mercyful Fate classics, and even the instrumental \"To One Far Away\" is pure metal joy. The band would breakup not long after \"Don't Break the Oath\"'s initial release before getting back together some years later, but nothing they released since has compared to how powerful this album is. Contrary to what a previous reviewer has stated, it's no secret that Mercyful Fate and King Diamond are not for everyone. Yes, King's voice is an acquired taste to say the least, but this reviewer knows of fewer frontmen that can do lyrically and musically what King Diamond can; that's why he's been around for over 20 years. And I wouldn't necessarily call Dio \"real aggressive, kick a$$ metal\" either.",

            "Description": "Arguably the most original and critically acclaimed group to come from Denmark was Mercyful Fate. Mercyful Fate's nucleus comprised of the multi-octave vocals of King Diamond aka Kim Bendix Petersen, and the twin lead guitar attack of Hank Sherman aka Rene Krolmark and Michael Denner. 'Melissa' was the group's first formal recording and was a featured LP for Road Runner Records. Although 'Melissa' was originally released in 1983, and re-released in 1997, Roadrunner Records has remastered the songs and released this classic for your listening enjoyment. It includes the highly sought after early 1980's BBC sessions, two extra demo tracks of 'Black Funeral', and 'Curse of the Pharaohs' and a three track DVD featuring live footage of the band during early 1983. A commentary by King Diamond himself narrates the performance and the story of the group during that time frame. Mercyful Fate pioneered a sub genre of ultra heavy and complex music renown for its macabre lyrics, and Satanic/occultism driven imagery and attitude called Black Metal.",

            "Description": "The Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as fellow Nirvana touring bandmate Pat Smear as guitarist to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997) when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward.\r\n\r\nThey were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after touring with Foo Fighters as an unofficial member between 2006 and 2009. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011. The band's eight studio album, Sonic Highways, and their second recorded with Butch Vig, will be released in November 2014.[5] As of May 2014, the band's seven albums have sold a combined 11.1 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[6]",

Critic Steve Huey describes their music as \"uncompromising, intense, cathartic fusions of hard rock, funk, post-punk noise, and jazz experimentalism, with Rollins shouting angry, biting self-examinations and accusations over the grind.\r\n\r\nThe band have been categorized under the alternative metal, hard rock and post-hardcore genres.[8][9][10] They were part of the early 90s LA alternative metal scene, alongside bands such as Tool, Jane's Addiction, Rage Against the Machine and Green Jellÿ.[10] Their influences include 70s metal and rock bands, such as Black Sabbath, The Velvet Underground, Pink Fairies and Thin Lizzy.[8] Rollins' shout-singing style proved influential to later nu metal and alternative metal artists such as Coal Chamber, Korn, Chevelle, Godsmack and System of a Down.[8] Rollins Band have been covered by Pearl Jam.[11]",

            "Description": "Alice in Chains is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and songwriter Jerry Cantrell and original lead vocalist Layne Staley. The initial lineup was rounded out by drummer Sean Kinney and bassist Mike Starr, who was replaced in 1993 by Mike Inez.\r\n\r\nAlthough widely associated with grunge music, the band's sound incorporates heavy metal and acoustic elements. Since its formation, Alice in Chains has released five studio albums, three EPs, two live albums, four compilations, and two DVDs. The band is known for its distinctive vocal style, which often included the harmonized vocals of Staley and Cantrell.\r\n\r\nAlice in Chains rose to international fame as part of the grunge movement of the early 1990s, along with other Seattle bands such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. The band was one of the most successful music acts of the 1990s, selling over 20 million albums worldwide,[1] and over 14 million in the US alone.[2] In 1992, the band released their album Dirt, which was critically acclaimed and has been certified quadruple platinum. The band also achieved two No. 1 Billboard 200 releases, 14 top ten songs on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and nine Grammy Award nominations.\r\n\r\nAlthough never officially disbanding, Alice in Chains was plagued by extended inactivity from 1996 onwards due to Staley's substance abuse, which resulted in his death in 2002. The band reunited in 2005 with new lead vocalist William DuVall and released their fourth studio album, Black Gives Way to Blue, in 2009. The album was a success, receiving gold certification by the RIAA in 2010. Alice in Chains released their fifth studio album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here, on May 28, 2013,[3] and are currently on tour for this album.[4]",

In fact, they resided at the furthest end of the opposite spectrum, fusing the pummeling rhythm section of heavy metal, with the crunching three-chord speed and fury of American hardcore, topped off with Jerry A.'s snarling, larger than life baritone, spitting out declamation after declamation against the world. That would be larger than life in more ways than just his Stentorian roar: Jerry, like guitarist Pig Champion, and for that matter, drummer Thee Slayer Hippy, are veritable giants, in height and girth.  Feel the Darkness is, simply stated, Poison Idea's most blistering moment in the sun, a steamrolling mass of furious speed and aggression, tempered with excellent drum and guitar work.",

            "Description": "Poison Idea was formed in 1980 by vocalist Jerry A. (aka Jerry Lang). The initial lineup consisted of Jerry A., Chris Tense (guitar), Glen Estes (bass), and Dean Johnson (drums). Inspired by Black Flag and other early Southern California hardcore acts, they were further influenced by Discharge and Los Angeles's the Germs. Germs singer Darby Crash's influence on singer Jerry A., vocally, lyrically, and philosophically, was considerable, and Poison Idea followed the Germs’ extremist punk ethic. Tense, who previously had played with Jerry in a group called the Stand, was replaced within a year by Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts (guitar), formerly of the Imperialist Pigs.\r\n\r\nPoison Idea’s debut, 1983's Pick Your King EP was a short, lo-fi blast of hardcore fury. The jacket featured a \"choice\" of two kings, Jesus (front cover) and Elvis Presley (back cover).\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Chris Tense returned to the band, this time on bass, replacing Glen Estes (later of Portland, Oregon punk/metal band Final Warning), and the group released the Record Collectors Are Pretentious Assholes 12” (the cover features Pig Champion’s substantial vinyl collection). The record found the band incorporating subtle rock elements into their music, which was further honed on their contributions to two 1985 compilations, “Laughing Boy” on the Drinking is Great EP (on which appeared other Oregon punk bands Final Warning, Lockjaw and E-13), and “Typical” and “Die on Your Knees” on the legendary Cleanse the Bacteria LP (compiled by Pushead for his own Pusmort label).\r\n\r\nWith the release of 1986’s Kings of Punk LP, Poison Idea had fully moved beyond the breakneck hardcore of their early records to a potent, driving and ultimately more intricate and sophisticated hardcore/hard rock fusion that incorporated the accessibility of hard rock without sacrificing the power of hardcore.\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Kings of Punk, the band went through several rapid lineup changes (mostly in the rhythm section), and then added lead guitarist Eric \"Vegetable\" Olson, a gifted musician who wrote many PI tunes during his tenure in the band (even contributing a piano vamp on one track). The band then released War All the Time (named for the Charles Bukowski book) in 1987. War All the Time and the EPs that followed (the Getting the Fear 12\" and the Filthkick 7\") found them further developing the rock/hardcore sound first established on Kings of Punk, which they would hone in 1990 with Feel the Darkness.\r\n\r\nAround this time, after numerous lineup changes, PI had convened one of their more stable lineups in Jerry A., Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts, Charley \"Myrtle Tickner\" Nims (bass) and Steve \"Thee Slayer Hippy\" Hanford (drums), with Kid Cocksman and then Aldine Strichnine on second guitar. By this time, their drinking habits and hard living were beginning to catch up with them: the band weighed in at about 1,300 lb. collectively, and Pig Champion in particular was very fat, often having to play sitting down. They also established their own record label in 1989, American Leather (named for the Germs song), and released two records the same year: a reissue of their 1982 demo Darby Crash Rides Again and the Discontent 7”.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the band released Feel the Darkness. After the release of Feel the Darkness, Aldine Strychnine was thrown out of the band, and Mondo returned this time on guitar, for the 1991 tour. PI then released Blank Blackout Vacant in 1992, and, before seemingly splitting in 1993, they released We Must Burn.\r\n\r\nWhen Pig Champion left the band in 1993, shortly before the recording and release of the live album on Your Choice Records produced by Tobby Holzinger, PI effectively called it quits. Jerry A pursued a solo project called Gift with his wife and Thee Slayer Hippy, and in 1998 the original line-up reunited for a 7\" EP on released on Taang! (who reissued their early catalogue), but broke up following an aborted tour.\r\n\r\nReflex/Wolfpack Records also did two vinyl reissues of the band. First Kings of Punk in 2003. Then later in 2005 a compilation 12\" containing the Pick Your King EP and the 'Learning To Scream' EP.",

By 1998, the band had understandably grown frustrated with this situation and decided to confront the problem head-on by reissuing all these rarities.",

            "Description": "Metallica were easily the best, most influential heavy metal band of the '80s and '90s. Responsible for bringing the genre back to Earth, the bandmates looked and talked like they were from the street, shunning the usual rock star games of metal musicians during the mid-'80s pop-metal renaissance. Metallica also expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions. The release of 1983's Kill 'Em All marked the beginning of the legitimization of heavy metal's underground, bringing new complexity and depth to thrash metal. With each album, the band's playing and writing improved; James Hetfield developed a signature rhythm playing that matched his growl, while lead guitarist Kirk Hammett became one of the most copied guitarists in metal. To complete the package, Lars Ulrich's thunderous (yet complex) drumming clicked in perfectly with Cliff Burton's innovative bass playing.",

The album was a landmark for AC/DC and included their first ever radio hit (in the U.S.) in \"Highway To Hell\". The album is a hard rock lover's dream, with big power chords, lead breaks and powerful vocals. The songs that standout on this release (which make up for more than half the album) are the title track \"Highway To Hell\", \"Girls Got Rhythm\", \"Shot Down In Flames\", \"Get It Hot\", \"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\", \"Walk All Over You\", and \"Touch Too Much\". This newly remastered cd which is now under the Epic label sounds much better than the older 1994 remastered version. The bottom end, mid-range and output level have all been increased dramatically. I've actually compared them and found this new release to be the superior of the two. The digipak that holds the cd is very attractive and includes a booklet with colorful photos, etc. If you enjoy groups such as Judas Priest, UFO, Def Leppard, Krokus, Scorpions, etc. than you'll won't be disappointed with \"Highway To Hell",

Die Toten Hosen (the name literally translates as \"the Dead Trousers\") was formed in 1982 from the ashes of two Düsseldorf punk bands, ZK and KFC. Considering that three members of the Hosen were named Andreas, they took stage names to avoid confusion: vocalist Campino (b. Andreas Frege; June 22, 1962), guitarist Breiti (b. Andreas Breitkopf; Feb. 6, 1964), rhythm guitarist Kuddel (b. Andreas Von Holst; June 11, 1964), bassist Andi (b. Andreas Meurer; July 24, 1962), and drummer Trini (b. Klaus-Dieter Trimpop; June 10, 1951). Die Toten Hosen self-released their first album, Opel Gang, in 1983, and several months later, EMI signed the group and reissued the LP. EMI soon grew disenchanted with the band (particularly after they were sued by German pop icon Heino after they parodied him in concert), and Virgin released their next album, Unter Falscher Flagge, in 1984; the following year, Trini vacated the drum stool to become the group's manager, and Wölli (b. Wolfgang Rohde; Jan. 9, 1963) took over on percussion. In 1986, the band released Damenwahl, which fared well on the charts and gave them their first taste of corporate sponsorship -- Fromms, a major condom manufacturer, helped promote the Damenwahl tour and provided samples of their products to hand out to fans. A live album followed, 1987's Bis Zum Bitteren Ende, and the group finally moved from cult favorites to a real commercial force in Germany with 1988's Ein Kleines Bisschen Horrorschau, which rose to number seven on the German charts.",

        "Description": "Heavy yet Melodic, \"Inside Yours\" was as impressive and real as anything that was coming out of Seattle at the time.\r\n\r\nA lot has been said in terms of what influenced grunge in its form. Most point to a collision of punk and arena rock, which is indeed true, however the influence of 70's era funk was evident in the sence that a lot of 'grunge\" though heavy and aggressive, had a groove not found in other forms of hard rock (excepting of course, bands who wore their funk influences on their musical sleeves like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Primus and Big Chief)\r\n\r\nIn grunge that funk influence was more sublime, more integrated and thus giving the melodies and power chords a sense of motion which made for some compelling music. Gruntruck embodied this with tracks like \"Paint\" and \"So Long\" which bust into power funk tangents amid the sweat and leather aesthetic, giving the general sound a psychedelic elegance that typified \"grunge\". All art-phaggy posturing aside, I sum this record up as just plain rockin' and is a document of the last truly innovative movement of Rock and Roll.",

A break in recording for the band to play some November and December dates with Tank was followed by Clarke producing Tank's debut album with help from Will Reid Dick. Clarke was unhappy with the Maile produced sessions and decided that the album should be recorded themselves, although Lemmy lamented at the time that \"it's a shame to have lost Vic in a way because I thought it was successful\".\r\n\r\nThe album was recorded during the best part of late January and February 1982 at Morgan Studios and Ramport Studios in London, with Clarke producing and Dick engineering. The band retrospectively acknowledge that this was a bad move, with Lemmy claiming in 2000 that the album was \"bad, inferior to anything else we've ever done. Having Eddie produce it was a mistake that even he would now probably admit to\".[7]\r\n\r\nThe writing of lyrics and recording of vocals are tasks that Lemmy performs once the recording of the music has been completed. Struggling to think of a name for the title track for the album, he remembered the time the band had performed live under the name Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell for contractual reasons (a subsequent album What's Words Worth? was released of that event), and decided this was an apt name for this project. The name was eventually shortened to simply Iron Fist.",

The band's heavy cross over style and energetic stage show made for exciting shows around the Bay Area as well as on their one and only European tour. The band didn't last very long and in 1988 dissolved to form a new band Two Bit Thief which had a more rock'n roll leaning sound.",

Responsible for bringing the genre back to Earth, the bandmates looked and talked like they were from the street, shunning the usual rock star games of metal musicians during the mid-'80s pop-metal renaissance. Metallica also expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions. The release of 1983's Kill 'Em All marked the beginning of the legitimization of heavy metal's underground, bringing new complexity and depth to thrash metal. With each album, the band's playing and writing improved; James Hetfield developed a signature rhythm playing that matched his growl, while lead guitarist Kirk Hammett became one of the most copied guitarists in metal. To complete the package, Lars Ulrich's thunderous (yet complex) drumming clicked in perfectly with Cliff Burton's innovative bass playing.",

            "Description": "Known for such powerful hits as \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" and \"The Trooper,\" Iron Maiden were and are one of the most influential bands of the heavy metal genre. The often-imitated band has existed for over nearly four decades, pumping out wild rock similar to Judas Priest. Iron Maiden have always been an underground attraction; although failing to ever obtain any real media attention in the U.S. (critics claimed them to be Satanists due to their dark musical themes and their use of grim mascot \"Eddie\"), they still became well-known throughout the world and have remained consistently popular throughout their career. Iron Maiden were one of the first groups to be classified as \"British metal,\" and, along with Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and a host of other bands, set the rock scene for the '80s.\r\n\r\nIron Maiden were first formed in 1976 by bassist Steve Harris, who would soon join up with rhythm guitarist Tony Parsons, drummer Doug Sampson, and vocalist Paul Di'Anno. Before finally obtaining a record deal, the group played in local areas throughout the '70s, receiving a fair amount of London airplay. Parsons replaced Dennis Stratton, and the band made its record debut in 1980 with the self-titled Iron Maiden album. Although the release was recorded in a hurry, it was nonetheless a hit in the U.K. due to the single \"Running Free.\" Iron Maiden's 1981 follow-up, Killers, displayed a harder approach to their music than before, and also saw the replacement of Stratton with Adrian Smith. Due to his uncontrollable alcohol addiction, Di'Anno was forced to part company with the group and would soon be replaced with vocalist Bruce Dickinson in 1982 for the band's groundbreaking Number of the Beast. This album, boasting such songs as the title track and \"Hallowed Be Thy Name,\" would come to be known as one of the greatest rock recordings of all time. Since the unexpected worldwide success of Beast made Iron Maiden international rock superstars, they changed very little of their style for their next album, Piece of Mind. They undertook two major tours before recording 1983's Powerslave, which would go on to be another cult hit. The product of Powerslave's 11-month tour was 1985's Live After Death, a double live album that featured all of their biggest hit singles.",

        "Description": "The \"glory\" days of Hardcore Punk for the most part were dominated by EPs. The cause of this phenomenon is quite simple: economics. Many young punks found the DIY route the only feasible way of getting their message and music across and distributed to their fans. Hence the late-70's and early 80's saw an explosion of underground DIY produced EPs (many packed with as many tunes as could be fit within the time constraints of the EP format) filled with photocopied inserts/lyric sheets and killer artwork (just think of all those classic records put out by SST, Dischord, Touch & Go, and hundreds of other killer DIY label/distros who clutter our record collections and shaped our minds). POISON IDEA-\"Kings of Punk\" is a different sort of animal: a full-fledged LP from the supposedly waning days of hardcore 1986. POISON IDEA from Portland burst onto the scene with the truly stand-out innovative \"Pick Your King\" EP in 1983. I don't state this lightly, \"Pick Your King\" ranks along with NEGATIVE APPROACH's debut EP, BLACK FLAG's \"Six Pack\" EP, BAD BRAINS-ROIR Cassette, MINOR THREAT's \"Filler\" EP, SS DECONTROL-\"Kids Will Have Their Say\" 12\", SOA's \"No Policy\" EP, YDI's \"A Place In The Sun\" EP, STATE's \"No Illusions\" EP, ANTIDOTE's \"Thou Shalt Not Kill\" EP, and MDC's \"Multideath Corporations\" EP, as a true seminal testament to the sheer power of the hardcore ethos. POISON IDEA's \"Pick Your King\" EP garnered much praise and was followed up with the slightly meatier \"Record Collectors Are Pretentious A**holes\" 12\" EP in 1984.",

            "Description": "Poison Idea was formed in 1980 by vocalist Jerry A. (aka Jerry Lang). The initial lineup consisted of Jerry A., Chris Tense (guitar), Glen Estes (bass), and Dean Johnson (drums). Inspired by Black Flag and other early Southern California hardcore acts, they were further influenced by Discharge and Los Angeles's the Germs. Germs singer Darby Crash's influence on singer Jerry A., vocally, lyrically, and philosophically, was considerable, and Poison Idea followed the Germs’ extremist punk ethic. Tense, who previously had played with Jerry in a group called the Stand, was replaced within a year by Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts (guitar), formerly of the Imperialist Pigs.\r\n\r\nPoison Idea’s debut, 1983's Pick Your King EP was a short, lo-fi blast of hardcore fury. The jacket featured a \"choice\" of two kings, Jesus (front cover) and Elvis Presley (back cover).\r\n\r\nIn 1984, Chris Tense returned to the band, this time on bass, replacing Glen Estes (later of Portland, Oregon punk/metal band Final Warning), and the group released the Record Collectors Are Pretentious Assholes 12” (the cover features Pig Champion’s substantial vinyl collection). The record found the band incorporating subtle rock elements into their music, which was further honed on their contributions to two 1985 compilations, “Laughing Boy” on the Drinking is Great EP (on which appeared other Oregon punk bands Final Warning, Lockjaw and E-13), and “Typical” and “Die on Your Knees” on the legendary Cleanse the Bacteria LP (compiled by Pushead for his own Pusmort label).\r\n\r\nWith the release of 1986’s Kings of Punk LP, Poison Idea had fully moved beyond the breakneck hardcore of their early records to a potent, driving and ultimately more intricate and sophisticated hardcore/hard rock fusion that incorporated the accessibility of hard rock without sacrificing the power of hardcore.\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of Kings of Punk, the band went through several rapid lineup changes (mostly in the rhythm section), and then added lead guitarist Eric \"Vegetable\" Olson, a gifted musician who wrote many PI tunes during his tenure in the band (even contributing a piano vamp on one track). The band then released War All the Time (named for the Charles Bukowski book) in 1987. War All the Time and the EPs that followed (the Getting the Fear 12\" and the Filthkick 7\") found them further developing the rock/hardcore sound first established on Kings of Punk, which they would hone in 1990 with Feel the Darkness.\r\n\r\nAround this time, after numerous lineup changes, PI had convened one of their more stable lineups in Jerry A., Tom \"Pig Champion\" Roberts, Charley \"Myrtle Tickner\" Nims (bass) and Steve \"Thee Slayer Hippy\" Hanford (drums), with Kid Cocksman and then Aldine Strichnine on second guitar. By this time, their drinking habits and hard living were beginning to catch up with them: the band weighed in at about 1,300 lb. collectively, and Pig Champion in particular was very fat, often having to play sitting down. They also established their own record label in 1989, American Leather (named for the Germs song), and released two records the same year: a reissue of their 1982 demo Darby Crash Rides Again and the Discontent 7”.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the band released Feel the Darkness. After the release of Feel the Darkness, Aldine Strychnine was thrown out of the band, and Mondo returned this time on guitar, for the 1991 tour. PI then released Blank Blackout Vacant in 1992, and, before seemingly splitting in 1993, they released We Must Burn.\r\n\r\nWhen Pig Champion left the band in 1993, shortly before the recording and release of the live album on Your Choice Records produced by Tobby Holzinger, PI effectively called it quits. Jerry A pursued a solo project called Gift with his wife and Thee Slayer Hippy, and in 1998 the original line-up reunited for a 7\" EP on released on Taang! (who reissued their early catalogue), but broke up following an aborted tour.\r\n\r\nReflex/Wolfpack Records also did two vinyl reissues of the band. First Kings of Punk in 2003. Then later in 2005 a compilation 12\" containing the Pick Your King EP and the 'Learning To Scream' EP.",

        "Description": "Einstürzende Neubauten's first album, as one might imagine, is their most primitive and radical effort, the purest expression of their original aesthetic. This makes the album both historically significant and conceptually intriguing, of course, but what's most interesting about this album is that it still sounds surprising decades after its release. Often, albums that are considered extreme art statements upon their debut sound almost quaint a few years later, but while Kollaps perhaps sounds less extreme to ears that heard industrial music turned into disco pabulum by the likes of Nine Inch Nails than it did before, songs like the eight-minute title track and the rumbling live closer, \"Negativ Nein,\" are still a fascinating blend of rhythm and random bashing, tonality and atonality, with anguished vocals by Blixa Bargeld that often seem to have little connection with anything else in the piece. The brief tracks, like the 80-second \"Sehnsucht,\" are even more extreme explorations of pure noise. Starting as early as the next album, Einstürzende Neubauten would begin slowly introducing more mainstream musical concepts into their aesthetic, making Kollaps as undiluted a listening experience as there is in the entire catalog.",

            "Description": "Along with Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle, Germany's Einstürzende Neubauten (\"collapsing new buildings\") helped pioneer industrial music with an avant-garde mix of white-noise guitar drones, vocals verging on the unlistenable at times, and a clanging, rhythmic din produced by a percussion section consisting of construction materials, power tools, and various metal objects. Einstürzende Neubauten were founded by vocalist/guitarist Blixa Bargeld and percussionist/American expatriate N.U. Unruh in Berlin as a performance art collective; their early activities included a seemingly inexplicable half-naked appearance on the Berlin Autobahn, where the duo spent some time beating on the sides of a hole in an overpass. The group's early lineup also included percussionists Beate Bartel and Gudrun Gut, plus contributor and sound engineer Alexander Van Borsig\r\n\r\nKollapsEinstürzende Neubauten's earliest recordings are mostly unstructured, free-form noise issued on various cassettes and singles, including their first single \"Fuer den Untergang,\" the 1981 EP Schwarz, and the 1982 album Kollaps. Some of these recordings are compiled on the Strategies Against Architecture '80-'83 collection, with live shows on the cassette-only 2x4. Bartel and Gut were replaced by ex-Abwräts member F.M. Einheit (who served as Neubauten's chief machinery operator) in 1983, when guitarist and electronics expert Alexander Hacke and Abwräts bassist Mark Chung also joined. A tour of England opening for the Birthday Party resulted in a contract with Some Bizarre Records, which released the slightly more structured Zeichnungen des Patienten O.T., as well as consternation from club owners and journalists over Neubauten's stage demolitions and frequent ensuing violence.",

        "Description": "After an exhaustive five-year litigation battle between the band and their label management, Tool offer up the latest chapter in their musical self-discovery in Lateralus. Make no mistake, this is a prog rock record, reminiscent of King Crimson and Meddle-era Pink Floyd, with a hint of Rush mutated with Tool's signature sonic assault on the ears. Lateralus demands close listening from the first piece onward, as it becomes quickly apparent that this is not going to be an album one can listen to and accept at face value. Complex rhythm changes, haunting vocals, and an onslaught of changes in dynamics make this an album other so-called metal groups could learn from.",

            "Description": "Tool's greatest breakthrough was to meld dark underground metal with the ambition of art rock. Although Metallica wrote their multi-sectioned, layered songs as if they were composers, they kept their musical attack ferociously at street level. Tool didn't. They embraced the artsy, bohemian preoccupations of Jane's Addiction while they simultaneously paid musical homage to the relentlessly bleak visions of grindcore, death metal, and thrash. Even with their post-punk influences, they executed their music with the aesthetic of prog rock, alternating between long, detailed instrumental interludes and lyrical rants in their songs.\r\n\r\nUndertowTool had a knack for conveying the strangled, oppressive angst that the alternative nation of the early '90s claimed as its own. So, Tool were able to slip into the definition of alternative rock during the post-Nirvana era, landing a slot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993, which helped their first full-length debut album, Undertow, rocket to platinum status. By the time the band delivered its belated follow-up, Ænima, in 1996, alternative rock had lost its grip on the mainstream of America, and Tool's audience had shaped up as essentially metal-oriented, which meant that the group and the record didn't capture as big an audience as their first album, despite debuting at number two on the charts. After a co-headlining slot with Korn on Lollapalooza '97 wrapped up, Tool remained on the road, supporting Ænima until well into the next year.",

AC/DC's first stab at a \"real\" album - a break from the early \"novelty\" approach to songwriting and a move to the more focused album-oriented view that the band would perfect.\r\n\r\nLet There Be Rock, the fourth AC/DC album -- and first to see simultaneous international release -- is as lean and mean as the original lineup ever got. Shaved down to the bone -- there are only eight tracks, giving this a lethal efficiency even with a couple of meandering jams -- this is a high-voltage, brutal record, filled with \"Bad Boy Boogie.\" It has a bit of a bluesier edge than other AC/DC records, but this is truly the sound of the band reaching its peak. There's the near majesty of \"Let There Be Rock,\" there's Bon Scott acknowledging with a wink that \"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be,\" and then there's the monumental \"Whole Lotta Rosie.\" Which gets down to a key thing about AC/DC. If Led Zeppelin were celebrating a \"Whole Lotta Love,\" AC/DC got down to the grimy details in their leering tribute to the joys of sex with a plus-sized woman. And that's AC/DC's allure in a nutshell -- it's sweaty, dirty, nasty rock, music that is played to the last call and beyond, and they've rarely done that kind of rock better than they did here.",

In its own way, it was a reaction against the pompous art rock and lumbering arena rock of the early '70s. AC/DC's rock was minimalist -- no matter how huge and bludgeoning their guitar chords were, there was a clear sense of space and restraint.

The decision to jettison Roth (and all the Hendrix-ian baggage that came with him) was the first of many smart moves made by the band. Before \"Lovedrive\" was completed, the band would hire, record with, fire, then rehire Matthias Jabs. The band would also briefly rejoin with Michael Schenker(another great move), in what many fans have called the dream line up for Scorpions. Sadly, this line up only lasted a few months. Michael collapsed onstage during a performance with Scorpions in Europe, and chose to step down and go on sabbatical, but not before positively influencing the group as shown here.\r\nGiven the tumultuous circumstances under which the album was recorded, its' a minor miracle the album is any good at all. \"Lovedrive\" however is a four star effort and I believe the best album ever made by Scorpions. Song writing, both musical and lyrical, are prime, and the group emotes all over this album without sounding ridiculous or tired.\r\nThe frantically paced classic \"Another Piece of Meat\"(boy meets girl, love goes wrong at Tokyo kick boxing match), the title song \"Lovedrive\"(girl-loves-guy/guy-loves-Porsche), and the fantastic \"I Can't Get Enough\" (or \"How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Hard Rock\") are the three stand out numbers that efficiently showcase the strengths of Scorpions, effectively translating their live vibe onto",

Responsible for bringing the genre back to Earth, the bandmates looked and talked like they were from the street, shunning the usual rock star games of metal musicians during the mid-'80s pop-metal renaissance. Metallica also expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions. The release of 1983's Kill 'Em All marked the beginning of the legitimization of heavy metal's underground, bringing new complexity and depth to thrash metal. With each album, the band's playing and writing improved; James Hetfield developed a signature rhythm playing that matched his growl, while lead guitarist Kirk Hammett became one of the most copied guitarists in metal. To complete the package, Lars Ulrich's thunderous (yet complex) drumming clicked in perfectly with Cliff Burton's innovative bass playing.",

It also sounds a bit dated in parts. In terms of originality, craftsmanship, instrumental prowess, and King Diamond's application of his unique and controversial voice and vocal range, it was comprehensively surpassed by Diamond's later solo classics (particularly Them, Conspiracy, and The Eye), and even by Mercyful Fate's 1993 reunion album, In The Shadows (although I prefer the more dynamic rhythm section on Melissa than those on The Eye or In The Shadows).\r\nWhat puts this album in a supreme league of its own is a wickedly powerful aura that builds up throughout the album, which is something that no amount of musica training can achieve, and no review can adequately reflect. Reviewer 'stevex3' gives us a taste when he says 'I'm sure that this CD gets played at every gathering of demons, but you really cannot have any idea what that means unless you experience this album for yourself (preferably played loud in the dark), as different people will experience it differently, and will undoubtedly have a hard time explaining their experience.",

            "Description": "Arguably the most original and critically acclaimed group to come from Denmark was Mercyful Fate. Mercyful Fate's nucleus comprised of the multi-octave vocals of King Diamond aka Kim Bendix Petersen, and the twin lead guitar attack of Hank Sherman aka Rene Krolmark and Michael Denner. 'Melissa' was the group's first formal recording and was a featured LP for Road Runner Records. Although 'Melissa' was originally released in 1983, and re-released in 1997, Roadrunner Records has remastered the songs and released this classic for your listening enjoyment. It includes the highly sought after early 1980's BBC sessions, two extra demo tracks of 'Black Funeral', and 'Curse of the Pharaohs' and a three track DVD featuring live footage of the band during early 1983. A commentary by King Diamond himself narrates the performance and the story of the group during that time frame. Mercyful Fate pioneered a sub genre of ultra heavy and complex music renown for its macabre lyrics, and Satanic/occultism driven imagery and attitude called Black Metal.",

        "Description": "For the uninitiated to the quintessential hardcore band, this compilation, originally released in 1984, is essential. Not to be confused with the EP of the same name, the full-length collects the finest moments of Discharge with 17 tracks culled from the band's ample discography of mini albums and 7\" singles from its peak period. The choice cuts \"Warning,\" \"Never Again,\" and \"Hear Nothing, See Nothing, Say Nothing\" may dispel some myths about the invention of the hardcore movement, as Bad Brains, Black Flag, Minor Threat, and even Metallica were all clearly influenced by this phenomenally noisy punk unit -- not to mention the entire grindcore scene of Carcass, Godflesh, and especially Napalm Death, all of which have their roots in the extreme noise terror of Discharge. Many of the singles are unavailable elsewhere, making this an excellent intro to one of punk rock's most ferocious groups.",

            "Description": "Discharge are a British hardcore punk band formed in 1977 by Terence \"Tezz\" Roberts and Royston \"Rainy\" Wainwright. While the band had substantial line-up changes over its history, the classic line-up from the early 1980s featured bassist Wainwright, drummer Roberts, his brother Anthony \"Bones\" Roberts playing guitar, and vocalist Kelvin \"Cal\" Morris.[1]\r\n\r\nThe band is characterized by a minimalistic approach of music and lyrics, a heavy, distorted, and grinding guitar-driven sound and raw, shouted vocals similar to a political speech, with lyrics on anarchist and pacifist themes. AllMusic calls the band's sound a \"high-speed noise overload\" characterized by \"ferocious noise blasts\" [2] The band's 1982 debut album, Hear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing, went to number two on the UK Indie Charts and number 40 in the UK Album Chart. In the early 1980s, numerous singles and EPs placed in the top 10 of the UK Indie Charts, including the 1981 EP Why? (#1) and the 1982 single State Violence State Control.\r\n\r\nHear Nothing See Nothing Say Nothing paved the way for thrash metal, black metal, crust punk, grindcore and various extreme metal subgenres. The musical genre of d-beat is named after Discharge and their distinctive drumbeat.",

        "Title": "No sleep 'til Hammersmith",
        "Description": "Released in 1981, the live album No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith recaps the highlights from the legendary run of albums Motörhead released during the prior few years, namely Overkill, Bomber, and Ace of Spades. The band's lesser self-titled debut album is also accounted for here with two inclusions (\"Motörhead\" and \"Iron Horse\"), but by and large, the focus is on the standout songs from the aforementioned trio of classics. This alone makes No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith noteworthy, for it plays like a greatest-hits set, opening perfectly with \"Ace of Spades.\" But what makes it all the more noteworthy -- and more than simply a run-of-the-mill, gap-filling live album -- is the performance: in a word, it's breakneck. The trio of Lemmy (bass and vocals), \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke (guitar), and \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor (drums) absolutely rips loose through this 11-song set, upping the intensity and speed of the already intense and speedy studio recordings. Yes, believe it or not, these performances are even more crazed than their studio-recorded counterparts. Of course, the fidelity isn't as clear and the instruments aren't nearly as in relief, since this is a live recording (and while it's of high quality for live recordings of its day, it's relatively lo-fi by today's standards). Still, the breakneck nature of this performance distinguishes No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith from its studio predecessors, making it an excellent, recommended complement to those essentials. Moreover, it's an important release because it captures Motörhead live during the peak of the classic lineup's rise to fame. Motörhead could do no wrong at this point in time, as they were laying the foundation for the coming thrash movement, in a way, and their winning streak continues here on No Sleep 'Til Hammersmith, one of the best live metal albums of all time.",

            "Description": "When Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, the band's future was put into question. Within months rumors flew that ex-Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell would replace de la Rocha. And gossip fueled truth, for Cornell joined the rest of Rage in the studio in May 2001. The mix was great and a musical bond was in the making: Cornell, Tim Commerford, Brad Wilk, and Tom Morello spent the next year writing and recording. By spring 2002, the foursome were no longer going by the Rage Against the Machine name and signed on for Ozzfest. But before the summer tour even got underway, Cornell quit the new project. \r\nHe claimed it wasn't moving forward in the direction he'd hoped for. The breakdown didn't last, for Cornell rejoined by early fall. After tossing around the idea of being called Civilian, they settled on Audioslave. The single \"Cochise,\" named for the great American Indian chief who died free and unconquered, hit radio in September 2002, and Audioslave's Epic full-length debut was released that November. The self-titled album eventually went multi-platinum on the strength of \"Cochise\" and the moody rocker \"Like a Stone,\" and Audioslave supported it with gigs that included 2003 Lollapalooza dates. Cornell, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford returned in May 2005 with Out of Exile, which debuted at number one on Billboard. That same month they played an historic show in Havana, Cuba, that marked that country's first outdoor show by an American rock band (that fall releasing the whole shebang on the Live in Cuba DVD). Exile continued the band's platinum-selling ways -- singles like \"Be Yourself\" and \"Doesn't Remind Me\" went to the top of the charts -- and the guys wasted no time following up with album number three, Revelations, in early September 2006. Work on the album took only five weeks, since most of the songs had been fleshed out live over the previous year. In 2007, shortly after the members of Rage announced that they would reunite for that year's Coachella festival, Cornell left Audioslave, citing both personal and musical differences, and leaving the state of Audioslave uncertain.",

One of the best albums from one of the bands to define heavy metal, this album is chock-full of the best stuff from Sabbath's Osbourne years. (Where else will you be able to hear \"Rat Salad?\") The music isn't exactly complex, but it doesn't need to be; its importance lies in its evocative power, with which any teenager will be able to identify.",

            "Description": "Black Sabbath have been so influential in the development of heavy metal rock music as to be a defining force in the style. The group took the blues-rock sound of late-'60s acts like Cream, Blue Cheer, and Vanilla Fudge to its logical conclusion, slowing the tempo, accentuating the bass, and emphasizing screaming guitar solos and howled vocals full of lyrics expressing mental anguish and macabre fantasies. If their predecessors clearly came out of an electrified blues tradition, Black Sabbath took that tradition in a new direction, and in so doing helped give birth to a musical style that continued to attract millions of fans decades later.\r\n\r\nThe group was formed by four teenage friends from Aston, near Birmingham, England: Anthony \"Tony\" Iommi (b. Feb 19, 1948), guitar; William \"Bill\" Ward (b. May 5, 1948), drums; John \"Ozzy\" Osbourne (b. December 3, 1948), vocals; and Terence \"Geezer\" Butler (b. July 17, 1949), bass. They originally called their jazz-blues band Polka Tulk, later renaming themselves Earth, and they played extensively in Europe. In early 1969, they decided to change their name again when they found that they were being mistaken for another group called Earth. Butler had written a song that took its title from a film directed by Mario Bava, Black Sabbath, and the group adopted it as their name as well. As they attracted attention for their live performances, record labels showed interest, and they were signed to Philips Records in 1969. In January 1970, the Philips subsidiary Fontana released their debut single, \"Evil Woman (Don't Play Your Games with Me),\" a cover of a song that had just become a U.S. hit for Crow; it did not chart. The following month, a different Philips subsidiary, Vertigo, released Black Sabbath's self-titled debut album, which reached the U.K. Top Ten. Though it was a less immediate success in the U.S. -- where the band's recordings were licensed to Warner Bros. Records and appeared in May 1970 -- the LP broke into the American charts in August, reaching the Top 40, remaining in the charts over a year, and selling a million copies.",

Not the most important or most influential; not with the widest variety nor highest reach(although this IS AC/DC's widest & highest album); not the most seductive or inspiring; but the best.\r\n\r\nAn amazingly raw, blistering sound, but at the same time incredibly tight grooves. Hard rock you can headbang AND dance to, indeed. Like someone once said, AC/DC does what no one else can do, better than anyone else.\r\n\r\nThis was the first album w/Cliff Williams and he kicked the band up to a whole new level. Fantastic production by Vanda/Young, the last one they did before Mutt Lange took over. The remastering is indescribably brilliant, showcasing the equally brilliant interplay between Angus & Malcolm. The lead & rhythm guitars are distinct, loud, and powerful. No way you'd believe this album was released in 1978 if you didn't already know.\r\n\r\nAnd what rhythms and leads they are. Nine incredible riffs, instantly memorable. Easy to play(the riffs NOT the solos, of course), perhaps, but almost impossible to write. And the seven solos are among Angus' best, especially on Gone Shootin'. Fast solos, medium solos, slow solos, and on Damnation & Bullet no solo at all.",

Combined with Bon Scott's larynx-shredding vocals, the band spawned countless imitators over the next two decades and enjoyed commercial success well into the 2000s.",

            "Description": "Not only was Trust one of the few French bands able to cross their country's frontiers, but they also made it without having to drop their native language or their half-punk, half-heavy metal ethics along the way. And that's saying something. Formed in 1977 around Bernard \"Bernie\" Bonvoisin (vocals), Nobert \"Nono\" Krief (guitars), Yves \"Vivi\" Brusco (bass), and an ever-changing set of drummers (including Iron Maiden's Clive Burr and Nicko McBrain), the band came up up a mix of influences, the most obvious of which might be AC/DC (with whom they toured a bit) and early Iron Maiden. But if Trust was musically a shiny killing machine (thanks, mainly, to Nono's guitar playing abilities and firepower), a large part of their appeal came from Bernie's energy and socially concerned lyrics, which earned them occasional censorship. If their most famous hit remains \"Antisocial\" (covered in 1988 by New York thrashers Anthrax on their State of Euphoria LP), the early days Trust actually came up with a whole bunch of molotov cocktails. It was all about fingerpointing the greedy boss, the abusive policeman, the broadcasted lesson-giver, the hypocrisy-driven religious man, and singing for the weak, the poor, the abused. That may have been the key to their success, but it was sincere. The '80s quickly saw their popularity drop after the heights of 1979's eponymous album, 1980's Repression, and 1981's Marche ou Crève. Nono went on to became Johnny Hallyday's stage guitarist, and Bernie became a comedian and director (1997's Les Démons de Jésus being his most striking, cruelly funny effort). The band re-formed from time to time, to tour a little, release new tracks, and/or live albums. (Note: some of their LPs are available with English-sung lyrics, including 1980's classic Repression).",

            "Description": "Rage Against the Machine, commonly abbreviated as RATM, is an American rap metal band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1991, the group consists of rapper/vocalist Zack de la Rocha, bassist and backing vocalist Tim Commerford, guitarist Tom Morello and drummer Brad Wilk. They draw inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as hip hop acts such as Afrika Bambaataa,[1] Public Enemy, the Beastie Boys and Dutch crossover band Urban Dance Squad.[2] Rage Against the Machine is best known for its leftist political views, which are expressed in many of its songs. As of 2010, they have sold over 16 million records worldwide.[3]\r\n\r\nIn 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial and critical success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza festival. In 2003, the album was ranked number 368 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band's third album, The Battle of Los Angeles, followed in 1999, and in 2003, the album was ranked number 426 on the same list. During their initial nine-year run, they became one of the most popular and influential bands in music history, according to music journalist Colin Devenish.[4] They were also ranked No. 33 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band had a large influence on the nu metal genre which emerged during the late 1990s.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, the band released the cover album, Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over the direction of the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup. De la Rocha started a low-key solo career, while the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Up until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. As of 2014, the group has no plans to record new material.[5]",

            "Description": "Not only was Trust one of the few French bands able to cross their country's frontiers, but they also made it without having to drop their native language or their half-punk, half-heavy metal ethics along the way. And that's saying something. Formed in 1977 around Bernard \"Bernie\" Bonvoisin (vocals), Nobert \"Nono\" Krief (guitars), Yves \"Vivi\" Brusco (bass), and an ever-changing set of drummers (including Iron Maiden's Clive Burr and Nicko McBrain), the band came up up a mix of influences, the most obvious of which might be AC/DC (with whom they toured a bit) and early Iron Maiden. But if Trust was musically a shiny killing machine (thanks, mainly, to Nono's guitar playing abilities and firepower), a large part of their appeal came from Bernie's energy and socially concerned lyrics, which earned them occasional censorship. If their most famous hit remains \"Antisocial\" (covered in 1988 by New York thrashers Anthrax on their State of Euphoria LP), the early days Trust actually came up with a whole bunch of molotov cocktails. It was all about fingerpointing the greedy boss, the abusive policeman, the broadcasted lesson-giver, the hypocrisy-driven religious man, and singing for the weak, the poor, the abused. That may have been the key to their success, but it was sincere. The '80s quickly saw their popularity drop after the heights of 1979's eponymous album, 1980's Repression, and 1981's Marche ou Crève. Nono went on to became Johnny Hallyday's stage guitarist, and Bernie became a comedian and director (1997's Les Démons de Jésus being his most striking, cruelly funny effort). The band re-formed from time to time, to tour a little, release new tracks, and/or live albums. (Note: some of their LPs are available with English-sung lyrics, including 1980's classic Repression).",

Led by the unique vocal stylings of screeching banshee Udo Dirkschneider, the band forged an instantly recognizable sound and was notorious as one of the decade's fiercest live acts. Despite recording two of the best heavy metal albums of the decade in Restless & Wild and Balls to the Wall, Accept remained too heavy and extreme for American audiences to embrace -- even when they tried to tone down their act with more melodic songs. Ultimately having conquered the rest of the world, but with their career stalled in the U.S., Accept fell apart, but reunited years later to confront a radically changed music marketplace.",

        "Description": "In light of this record, Out of Exile feels driven by Cornell, which itself was a shift away from the Rage-driven debut. Here, the two are integrated fully into a distinctive sound, one that's tight and focused, one that's aggressive but not overly heavy. Also, Audioslave has become increasingly rhythm-driven instead of riff-driven; even on the slower songs and heavy rockers, the pulse and pull of the rhythm defines the song more than the riff. Given this emphasis on rhythm, it's not a surprise that Audioslave displays an overt funk and soul influence here.",

            "Description": "When Zack de la Rocha left Rage Against the Machine in October 2000, the band's future was put into question. Within months rumors flew that ex-Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell would replace de la Rocha. And gossip fueled truth, for Cornell joined the rest of Rage in the studio in May 2001. The mix was great and a musical bond was in the making: Cornell, Tim Commerford, Brad Wilk, and Tom Morello spent the next year writing and recording. By spring 2002, the foursome were no longer going by the Rage Against the Machine name and signed on for Ozzfest. But before the summer tour even got underway, Cornell quit the new project. \r\nHe claimed it wasn't moving forward in the direction he'd hoped for. The breakdown didn't last, for Cornell rejoined by early fall. After tossing around the idea of being called Civilian, they settled on Audioslave. The single \"Cochise,\" named for the great American Indian chief who died free and unconquered, hit radio in September 2002, and Audioslave's Epic full-length debut was released that November. The self-titled album eventually went multi-platinum on the strength of \"Cochise\" and the moody rocker \"Like a Stone,\" and Audioslave supported it with gigs that included 2003 Lollapalooza dates. Cornell, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford returned in May 2005 with Out of Exile, which debuted at number one on Billboard. That same month they played an historic show in Havana, Cuba, that marked that country's first outdoor show by an American rock band (that fall releasing the whole shebang on the Live in Cuba DVD). Exile continued the band's platinum-selling ways -- singles like \"Be Yourself\" and \"Doesn't Remind Me\" went to the top of the charts -- and the guys wasted no time following up with album number three, Revelations, in early September 2006. Work on the album took only five weeks, since most of the songs had been fleshed out live over the previous year. In 2007, shortly after the members of Rage announced that they would reunite for that year's Coachella festival, Cornell left Audioslave, citing both personal and musical differences, and leaving the state of Audioslave uncertain.",

Responsible for bringing the genre back to Earth, the bandmates looked and talked like they were from the street, shunning the usual rock star games of metal musicians during the mid-'80s pop-metal renaissance. Metallica also expanded the limits of thrash, using speed and volume not for their own sake, but to enhance their intricately structured compositions. The release of 1983's Kill 'Em All marked the beginning of the legitimization of heavy metal's underground, bringing new complexity and depth to thrash metal. With each album, the band's playing and writing improved; James Hetfield developed a signature rhythm playing that matched his growl, while lead guitarist Kirk Hammett became one of the most copied guitarists in metal. To complete the package, Lars Ulrich's thunderous (yet complex) drumming clicked in perfectly with Cliff Burton's innovative bass playing.",

Signing with independent Neat Records, the trio joined labelmates Venom in laying the groundwork for what would become known as thrash metal by picking up where '70s noisemongers Motorhead had left off. Not as satanically-inclined or downright silly as Venom, Raven were much better musicians and played with the raw energy and reckless power that epitomized the New Wave of British Heavy Metal. As the movement approached its peak in 1981, Raven rode its crest with the self-labeled \"athletic rock\" of their album, Rock Until You Drop, still considered a classic of the genre.\r\n\r\nSubsequent Neat releases -- Wiped Out, All for One and Live at the Inferno -- weren't quite as focused but helped the band solidify their fan-base and attract the attention of Atlantic Records. Unfortunately, signing with the major record company marked the turning point of Raven's fortunes as 1985's disappointing Stay Hard saw the band opting for an overtly commercial direction. Raven gradually relinquished their pop-metal aspirations, but by the time they attempted a full return to their roots with 1988's Nothing Exceeds Like Excess, their momentum had been irretrievably lost, along with drummer Wacko. The group has continued to record throughout the '90s on a variety of independent labels with new drummer Joey Hassewander, without anything close to mainstream success.",

It is clear that so many bands that would come later were listening to this album way back when. Those people who think that what Aerosmith does now is great, needs to go back and listen to a REAL rock album, ROCKS. This is Aerosmith's crowning achievemnet.",

            "Description": "Aerosmith is an American rock band, sometimes referred to as \"the Bad Boys from Boston\" and \"America's Greatest Rock and Roll Band.\" Their style, which is rooted in blues-based hard rock, has come to also incorporate elements of pop, heavy metal, and rhythm and blues,and has inspired many subsequent rock artists. The band was formed in Boston, Massachusetts in 1970. Guitarist Joe Perry and bassist Tom Hamilton, originally in a band together called the Jam Band, met up with vocalist/harmonica player Steven Tyler, drummer Joey Kramer, and guitarist Ray Tabano, and formed Aerosmith. In 1971, Tabano was replaced by Brad Whitford, and the band began developing a following in Boston.\r\n\r\nThey were signed to Columbia Records in 1972, and released a string of gold and platinum albums, beginning with their 1973 eponymous debut album, followed by their 1974 album Get Your Wings. In 1975, the band broke into the mainstream with the album Toys in the Attic, and their 1976 follow-up Rocks cemented their status as hard rock superstars. Two additional albums followed in 1977 and 1979. The band's first five albums have since attained multi-platinum status. Throughout the 1970s, the band toured extensively and charted a dozen Hot 100 singles. By the end of the decade, they were among the most popular hard rock bands in the world and developed a loyal following of fans, often referred to as the \"Blue Army\". However, drug addiction and internal conflict took their toll on the band, which resulted in the departures of Perry and Whitford in 1979 and 1981, respectively; they were replaced by Jimmy Crespo and Rick Dufay. The band did not fare well between 1980 and 1984, releasing the album Rock in a Hard Place, which went gold but failed to match their previous successes.\r\n\r\nPerry and Whitford returned in 1984 and the band signed a new deal with Geffen Records. After a comeback tour, the band recorded Done with Mirrors (1985), which won some critical praise but failed to come close to commercial expectations. It was not until the band's collaboration with rap group Run–D.M.C. in 1986, and the 1987 multi-platinum release Permanent Vacation, that they regained the level of popularity they had experienced in the 1970s. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the band scored several hits and won numerous awards for music from the multi-platinum albums Pump (1989), Get a Grip (1993), and Nine Lives (1997), and embarked on their most extensive concert tours to date. The band also became a pop culture phenomenon with popular music videos and notable appearances in television, film, and video games. Their comeback has been described as one of the most remarkable and spectacular in rock 'n' roll history. Additional albums followed in 2001, 2004, and 2012. Since 2001, the band has toured every year except 2008. After 44 years of performing, the band continues to tour and record music.\r\n\r\nAerosmith is the best-selling American rock band of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide, including over 70 million albums in the United States alone. With 25 gold albums, 18 platinum albums, and 12 multi-platinum albums, they hold the record for the most gold albums by an American group, the most total certifications by an American group, and are tied for the most multi-platinum albums by an American group. The band has scored 21 Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, nine number-one Mainstream Rock hits, four Grammy Awards, six American Music Awards, and ten MTV Video Music Awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, and were included among both Rolling Stone's and VH1's lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2013, the band's principal songwriters, Tyler and Perry, were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",

            "Description": "The Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as fellow Nirvana touring bandmate Pat Smear as guitarist to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997) when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward.\r\n\r\nThey were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after touring with Foo Fighters as an unofficial member between 2006 and 2009. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011. The band's eight studio album, Sonic Highways, and their second recorded with Butch Vig, will be released in November 2014.[5] As of May 2014, the band's seven albums have sold a combined 11.1 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[6]",

Vocalist Walter Schreifels spews out enough angst-ridden lyrics, but what is important is how his voice fits into the dense wall of sound. Quicksand's music is about powerful anger, and the persistent, bludgeoning Slip delivers the goods.",

A self-titled EP soon followed, and in 1992, Quicksand issued their Polygram debut, Slip, earning airplay with the single \"Dine Alone.\" After touring in support of their sophomore effort, 1995's Manic Compression, the group disbanded, only to attempt an unfruitful reunion two years later before going their separate ways once more. Quicksand's former members have since cropped up in other outfits (Capone in Handsome, Schreifels in Rival Schools, etc.), and although they never broke out of cult status over the course of their two-album-long career, Quicksand's influence can still be felt, especially on such bands as Grade, Absolve, Thursday, and At the Drive-In, among others.",

Retaining their concussive and visceral punk roots, the band took their first solid steps into previously uncharted territory-employing non-traditional instruments, tribal chants, radically slower tempos and densely layered, folk-influenced melodies, essentially creating a post-metal blueprint in the process. \"Sterile Vision\" breathes with a barbaric folk tinge, while the menacing industrial rhythms of \"Flight\" and \"The Web\" steamroll the senses. The maniacal trepidation of \"Zero\" acts as the ying to the melancholic yang of \"Empty.\" Neurot Records is proud to keep the flame burning with this deluxe reissue. Adding demo versions of \"Zero\" and the title track along with a bonus live cut, the updated Souls at Zero is a vital document of one of the most influential bands in heavy music. Redesigned artwork by the revered Josh Graham completes a package worthy of timeless worship.",

        "Description": "This album rocks from start to finish and is easily one of the best Anthrax albums especially Belladonna days. This album was widely more accepted in a grunge filled time, when bands like Motley Crue, Judas Priest and Iron Maiden also tested the waters by releasing new music with a different vocalist. While I like all those mentioned bands and their respective albums, SOWN was critical praised and successful to where Anthrax fans new and old gobbled it up. One of my all time favs from 1993 or from any era. Armored Saint frontman John Bush saved Anthrax... for a while anyway. I liked Joey Belladonna, but Bush gave Anthrax a more bluesy muscular feel.",

The group was considered one of the leaders of the thrash metal scene during the 1980s. When the genre's popularity increased, Anthrax was one of its \"big four\" with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. As of 2014 the band has released ten studio albums, a number of singles and an EP with American hip hop group Public Enemy. According to Nielsen SoundScan Anthrax sold 2.5 million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with worldwide sales of over 15 million.",

The quintet doesn't compromise its integrity or its aesthetics, delivering its familiar Ramones-style pop songs at crash-and-burn tempos and continuing to rail against business as usual in corporate America. (The band's social critiques have always been a cut above the average hardcore punk's, as befits a group led by a vocalist pursuing his PhD at Cornell.) Especially effective is the opening track, \"Incomplete,\" which features guest guitar by Wayne Kramer of the MC5.",

        "Description": "A mere six months after releasing their stunning sophomore album, Wheels of Steel, Saxon almost managed to top themselves with the equally timeless Strong Arm of the Law, forever after dividing their fan base over which of the two delivered the ultimate Saxon long-playing experience. This time, instead of motorcycle engines revving, it's thunder and lightning launching the album in truly bombastic fashion via the embryonic thrashing of \"Heavy Metal Thunder.\" And then it soon becomes apparent that Saxon had learned a little something from their then-recent tour of England with Motörhead, because break-neck anthems like \"To Hell and Back Again,\" \"Taking Your Chances,\" the very naughty \"Sixth Form Girls,\" and the high-flying \"20,000 Ft\" just keep on coming at the listener, full speed ahead. A few more deliberate offerings are wisely sprinkled in to allow for some breathing room, and include the album's ever-popular title track (based on the band's true-life experience of being pulled over by highway police during their first American tour), the uniquely unimpressive \"Hungry Years,\" and the unusually political \"Dallas 1 PM,\" which details the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. In sum, as had been the case with Wheels of Steel, all the right ingredients pretty much fell into place for Saxon on this amazing record, and though it lacked as many clear-cut hits as its predecessor (namely \"Motorcycle Man,\" \"747,\" and \"Wheels of Steel\"), Strong Arm of the Law‘s unmatched consistency from start to finish makes it the definitive Saxon album in the eyes of many fans and critics. Suffice to say that you'd be hard pressed to find any New Wave of British Heavy Metal Top Ten list that doesn't include both of these efforts, and we'll leave it at that.",

Matt Cameron became the band's full-time drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990.\r\n\r\nSoundgarden was one of the seminal bands in the creation of grunge, a style of alternative rock that developed in Seattle, and was one of a number of grunge bands signed to the record label Sub Pop. Soundgarden was the first grunge band to sign to a major label (A&M Records, in 1988), though the band did not achieve commercial success until they popularized the genre in the early 1990s with Seattle contemporaries Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Alice in Chains.\r\n\r\nSoundgarden achieved its biggest success with the 1994 album Superunknown, which debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and yielded the Grammy Award-winning singles \"Black Hole Sun\" and \"Spoonman\". In 1997, the band broke up due to internal strife over its creative direction. After several years working on projects and other bands, Soundgarden reunited in 2010 and their sixth studio album, King Animal, was released two years later.[1]\r\n\r\nAs of 2012, Soundgarden had sold more than 10.5 million records in the United States,[2] and an estimated 22.5 million worldwide.",

        "Description": "Seminal NYC hardcore veterans Agnostic Front have changed the face of music throughout their 30-year long career. The two records that started it all, United Blood and Victim in Pain, are legendary New York hardcore release and were partially responsible for the creation of the hardcore genre itself. Now with their 11th studio album, The American Dream Died, the band has perhaps made their most aggressive album in recent years. From crossover, to proto grindcore, to subtle influences; there's something for every Agnostic Front fan. 'Myself and the band has never felt so confident and passionate about a release,' affirms vocalist Roger Miret. 'It's full of anger, rage and honesty; all the makings of a classic! The session was really intense and the results show it all!'",

The band's heavy cross over style and energetic stage show made for exciting shows around the Bay Area as well as on their one and only European tour. The band didn't last very long and in 1988 dissolved to form a new band Two Bit Thief which had a more rock'n roll leaning sound.",

        "Description": "Except for Diamond Head, probably no other New Wave of British Heavy Metal band had as much of an impact on the sound made famous by Metallica as Holocaust (see the metal legends' cover of Holocaust's \"The Small Hours\" -- not featured here). In fact, only the aforementioned Diamond Head and the great Iron Maiden could compare to Holocaust in terms of authentic, straightforward heavy metal intensity. Lyrically, the band didn't waste time with shag anthems à la Def Leppard or delve into grand historical themes like Maiden, they just plain rocked out -- Judas Priest-style. The classic \"Heavy Metal Mania\" (\"I've got heavy metal music in my blood\") and \"Smokin' Valves\" (\"I love to rock! I love to get down low\") are perfect examples, stating the obvious with endearing cheesiness. But Holocaust were about big, blunt riffs, not small talk. Just witness the Sabbath-inspired power chords which reign supreme on the title track, \"Mavrock,\" and their masterpiece, \"Death or Glory.\" The slightly looser \"Cryin' Shame\" is probably the only exception, standing out as the album's only obvious single thanks to its catchy riff. Out of print for nearly a decade, The Nightcomers was finally re-issued by Edgy Records in 2000. Remastered and packed with three excellent bonus tracks (including outstanding B-sides \"Love's Power\" and \"Only As Young As You Feel\"), it's a worthwhile treat for any serious N.W.O.B.H.M. fan.",

            "Description": "Hailing from Edinburgh, Scotland, Holocaust were formed in the late '70s, and featured vocalist Gary Lettice, guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, bassist Robin Begg, and drummer Nicky Arkless. Like many New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands, Holocaust cut their teeth in local clubs during the waning days of punk, before finally scoring an independent record deal and issuing 1981's seminal The Nightcomers. Though commercially unsuccessful, the album has remained a favorite of the genre and was later cited as a major influence by members of Metallica, who covered the song \"The Small Hours\" from the band's subsequent release, 1983's Live -- Hot Curry and Wine. But the band was already experiencing internal strife and fell apart before the recording of 1984's disjointed No Man's Land, which featured sole surviving original member John Mortimer handling vocals, guitars, and bass, and backed by drummer Steve Cowen. Five years would pass before the duo (along with bassist David Rosie) resurrected Holocaust once again, going on to release a number of solid efforts, including 1989's The Sound of Souls, 1992's Hypnosis of Birds, 1996's Spirits Fly, and 1997's Covenant. 2003 saw the band's work collected on the anthology Smokin Valves",

        "Description": "Bad Religion is more than just a punk rock band. They are a punk rock institution. They have existed for almost 20 years and have always been a part of the musical evolution that is independent music. Your Blink 182s, your Sum 41s, your New Found Glories; none of them would exist if it wasn't for Bad Religion. It is only fitting, then, that \"The Process Of Belief\" blows all of those bands [and about a million more] out of the water.\r\nThe most-hyped point about this album, of course, is the fact that guitarist/songwriter Brett Gurewitz is back in the band after the band's somewhat-failed stint on major label Atlantic Records and subsequent return to Brett's own label Epitaph. What does this mean? It means that vocalist Greg Graffin and Gurewitz wrote together for the first time significantly since 1994. This is the punk rock equivalent of John Lennon and Paul McCartney getting the band back together. If you're not familiar with them [and if that's the case, I feel sorry for you], maybe the basketball analogy of Michael Jordan and Phil Jackson both reuniting with the Chicago Bulls at the same time could help you understand the importance of the situation better. This is a huge deal, and the album definitely lives up to the pressure put upon it.\r\nFrom the second you press play, the disc shows no intention of letting up on intensity. The trio of opening tracks \"Supersonic,\" \"Prove It,\" and \"Can't Stop It\" plow through the listener in barely more than 3 minutes total, shushing all nay sayers who said this band had lost their passion for their music. The band has rarely sounded tighter with music this fast.",

Their lyrics often relate to matters of social responsibility. The band's lineup has changed several times over its lifespan, with lead vocalist Greg Graffin being the only consistent member; the current lineup, however, features three out of four of the band's original members (Graffin, Brett Gurewitz and Jay Bentley). Bad Religion has released sixteen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs (one of which is composed of covers of Christmas songs), and two DVDs (which were both recorded live).\r\n\r\nAlthough they gained a cult following with many of their early albums, Bad Religion did not experience major worldwide commercial success until the 1994 release of their eighth studio album Stranger Than Fiction, which spawned their biggest hits \"Infected\" and a re-recorded version of \"21st Century (Digital Boy)\", and was certified gold in both the United States and Canada. Their latest album, True North, was released on January 22, 2013. Bad Religion is one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time,[4] having sold over 5 million albums worldwide.",

Yea, it's pure speed metal allright but brutal speed metal. Not a light hearted affair at all. In terms of speed metal this is as fast as landmark albums like Reign in Blood, or Kill 'Em All. Best tracks are Ultra Violence (which actually has a frew chords stolen from Iron Madien at the start and end, but a very good 10 minute song!), Mistress of Pain, and Thrashers. However they are all good, just some better than others! If you're an old school metal guy, you can't lose on this one. BTW, don't miss Death Angel at Maritime on August 11th! First time they have played in 10 years.",

Death Angel has released seven studio albums, two demo tapes, one box set and two live albums.\r\n\r\nTwo independent releases, The Ultra-Violence (1987) and Frolic Through the Park (1988), attracted the attention of Geffen Records, which signed the quintet in 1989 and released their next album, Act III, one year later. While Death Angel was touring in support of Act III, drummer Andy Galeon was injured in a tour bus accident and needed more than a year to fully recover. This resulted in the band's break up in 1991. However, Death Angel reformed in 2001 (without original guitarist Gus Pepa) at the Thrash of the Titans benefit concert for Testament singer Chuck Billy. The band continues to record and perform today.",

The band's current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Tim McIlrath, lead guitarist Zach Blair, bassist Joe Principe and drummer Brandon Barnes. Former members are guitarists Dan Wlekinski, Kevin White, Todd Mohney and Chris Chasse, and drummers Toni Tintari and Dan Lumley.\r\n\r\nThe band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords, on which it released two studio albums, The Unraveling (2001) and Revolutions per Minute (2003). Both the albums met with considerable underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the major label Geffen. Their major label debut Siren Song of the Counter Culture (2004) brought the band mainstream success, producing several successful singles. Their next two albums, The Sufferer & the Witness (2006) and Appeal to Reason (2008), were also successful and peaked at number ten and number three on the Billboard 200 chart, respectively. Appeal to Reason was followed three years later by Endgame (2011).[1] All four albums released via Geffen were certified platinum in Canada, while three of these albums were certified gold in the United States.\r\n\r\nRise Against is also known for their advocacy of progressivism, supporting organisations such as Amnesty International and the It Gets Better Project. The band actively promotes animal rights and most of the members are straight edge (excluding Barnes), PETA supporters and vegetarians.",

            "Description": "Tool's greatest breakthrough was to meld dark underground metal with the ambition of art rock. Although Metallica wrote their multi-sectioned, layered songs as if they were composers, they kept their musical attack ferociously at street level. Tool didn't. They embraced the artsy, bohemian preoccupations of Jane's Addiction while they simultaneously paid musical homage to the relentlessly bleak visions of grindcore, death metal, and thrash. Even with their post-punk influences, they executed their music with the aesthetic of prog rock, alternating between long, detailed instrumental interludes and lyrical rants in their songs.\r\n\r\nUndertowTool had a knack for conveying the strangled, oppressive angst that the alternative nation of the early '90s claimed as its own. So, Tool were able to slip into the definition of alternative rock during the post-Nirvana era, landing a slot on the third Lollapalooza tour in 1993, which helped their first full-length debut album, Undertow, rocket to platinum status. By the time the band delivered its belated follow-up, Ænima, in 1996, alternative rock had lost its grip on the mainstream of America, and Tool's audience had shaped up as essentially metal-oriented, which meant that the group and the record didn't capture as big an audience as their first album, despite debuting at number two on the charts. After a co-headlining slot with Korn on Lollapalooza '97 wrapped up, Tool remained on the road, supporting Ænima until well into the next year.",

            "Description": "Judas Priest was one of the most influential heavy metal bands of the '70s, spearheading the New Wave of British Heavy Metal late in the decade. Decked out in leather and chains, the band fused the gothic doom of Black Sabbath with the riffs and speed of Led Zeppelin, as well as adding a vicious two-lead guitar attack; in doing so, they set the pace for much popular heavy metal from 1975 until 1985, as well as laying the groundwork for the speed and death metal of the '80s.\r\n\r\nFormed in Birmingham, England, in 1970, the group's core members were guitarist K.K. Downing and bassist Ian Hill. Joined by Alan Atkins and drummer John Ellis, the band played their first concert in 1971. Atkins' previous band was called Judas Priest, yet the members decided it was the best name for the new group. The band played numerous shows throughout 1971; during the year, Ellis was replaced by Alan Moore; by the end of the year, Chris Campbell replaced Moore. After a solid year of touring the U.K., Atkins and Campbell left the band in 1973 and were replaced by vocalist Rob Halford and drummer John Hinch. They continued touring, including a visit to Germany and the Netherlands in 1974. By the time the tour was completed, they had secured a record contract with Gull, an independent U.K. label. Before recording their debut album, Judas Priest added guitarist Glenn Tipton.\r\n\r\nRocka RollaRocka Rolla was released in September of 1974 to almost no attention. The following year, they gave a well-received performance at the Reading Festival and Hinch departed the band; he was replaced by Alan Moore. Later that year, the group released Sad Wings of Destiny, which earned some positive reviews. However, the lack of sales was putting the band in a dire financial situation, which was remedied by an international contract with CBS Records. Sin After Sin (1977) was the first album released under that contract; it was recorded with Simon Phillips, who replaced Moore. The record received positive reviews and the band departed for their first American tour, with Les Binks on drums.",

            "Description": "Van Halen is an American hard rock band formed in Pasadena, California, in 1972. From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony.[4]\n\nThe band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. The lead single, \"Jump\", became an international hit and their only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100. The following singles, \"Panama\" and \"I'll Wait\", both hit number 13 on the U.S. charts. The album went on to sell over 12 million copies in the U.S. alone. In 1985, the band replaced lead singer David Lee Roth with former Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. With Hagar, the group would release four U.S. number-one albums over the course of 11 years. Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, Best Of – Volume I. Former Extreme frontman Gary Cherone was quickly recruited as lead singer to replace Hagar, and Van Halen III was released in 1998. Cherone left the band in frustration in 1999 after the tour due to the poor commercial performance of the album.\n\nVan Halen went on hiatus until 2003 when they reunited with Hagar for a worldwide tour. The reunited band released a second greatest hits collection the following year, The Best of Both Worlds. Like Volume I before it, The Best of Both Worlds included material from both the Roth and Hagar eras but omitted any Cherone era tracks. The album featured three brand new tracks recorded by the reunited band, two of which were released as singles. Hagar again left Van Halen in 2005, and in 2006 Roth returned as lead vocalist for their highest-grossing tour, and one of the highest-grossing tours of that year. Anthony was not invited to participate in the tour and was essentially fired from the band, replaced by Wolfgang Van Halen, Eddie's son. In 2012, the band released the commercially and critically successful, A Different Kind of Truth, with Roth as lead vocalist. According to the RIAA, Van Halen is the 19th-best-selling band/artist in United States history, selling 56 million albums in the U.S.[5] They were also revealed at number 4 on the Billboard's top moneymakers list in 2013.[6][7] Van Halen is one of only five rock bands that have had two studio albums sell more than 10 million copies in the U.S.[8] Additionally, Van Halen charted the most number-one hits in the history of Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart and they are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 80 million records.[9][10]\n\nVan Halen achieved worldwide fame for their many popular songs and larger-than-life stage performances; they also became known for the drama surrounding the departures of former members. Controversy surrounded the band following the exits of Roth, Hagar, and Anthony; this controversy often included numerous conflicting press statements between the former members and the band. In 2007, Van Halen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.[11] VH1 ranked them 7th on their list of the top 100 hard rock artists of all time.",

        "Description": "Hard to say that this is \"the best\" Foo Fighters album because, after so many years, bands should really be defined by eras. I would consider the Foos first era ending, and second era beginning, with their double album, In Your Honor. Their \"classic\" album from that first era is The Colour and The Shape. It is considered, and will continue to be considered, a classic album in the rock genre.\n\nWasting Light is the best album of the Foos second era and, like TCATS, it will be considered a classic album in the rock genre. There is no track that is unlikeable, just a few that aren't as great as the others.\n\nHighlights of the album are the first two tracks, \"Bridge Burning\" and \"Rope\", are the best two songs I've heard to open an album since way back to the first tracks of \"Vs.\" by Pearl Jam, \"Go\" and \"Animal.\" \"Dear Rosemary\" is solid, the guitar work sounding a bit like \"Steady As She Goes\" by the Racounteurs, and a chorus that is all Dave Grohl, even with help from Bob Mould.\n\nThrashy and well-placed \"White Limo\" is juxtaposed with the ridiculously catchy \"Arlandria\" (\"you and what army? Arlandria!\"). \"These Days\" is such a great, soaring rock song that it is easy to forget that the lyrics are painfully honest and relate-able on a number of levels. \"Back and Forth\" is cheesy, but in a catchy, good way, and sounds like something of a homage to any number of late-80's rock tracks with it's chug-chug-chug guitar sound (listen to it, you'll get it).",

            "Description": "The Foo Fighters is an American rock band, formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl as a one-man project following the death of Kurt Cobain and the resulting dissolution of his previous band. The group got its name from the UFOs and various aerial phenomena that were reported by Allied aircraft pilots in World War II, which were known collectively as foo fighters. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters' 1995 debut album Foo Fighters, which featured Grohl as the only official member, Grohl recruited bassist Nate Mendel and drummer William Goldsmith, both formerly of Sunny Day Real Estate, as well as fellow Nirvana touring bandmate Pat Smear as guitarist to complete the lineup. The band began with performances in Portland, Oregon. Goldsmith quit during the recording of the group's second album, The Colour and the Shape (1997) when most of the drum parts were re-recorded by Grohl himself. Smear's departure followed soon afterward.\r\n\r\nThey were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl was fired before the recording of the group's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). The band briefly continued as a trio until Chris Shiflett joined as the band's lead guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album, One by One, in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and heavier material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album, Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace, in 2007. In 2010, it was confirmed that Smear had officially rejoined the band after touring with Foo Fighters as an unofficial member between 2006 and 2009. Over the course of the band's career, four of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album. The band's seventh studio album, Wasting Light, produced by Butch Vig was released in 2011. The band's eight studio album, Sonic Highways, and their second recorded with Butch Vig, will be released in November 2014.[5] As of May 2014, the band's seven albums have sold a combined 11.1 million copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.[6]",

        "Description": "All of the warning signs are right there on the cover: the band name in a jagged and stylized font, a close-up on someone playing an electric guitar, and dripping blood. Yeah, that's right, this is a metal album. It was pretty clear on Born a Lion that Danko Jones was already heading in this direction, with loud boogie-soaked riffs that owed more to AC/DC than the revved-up funk that served as the bedrock of the group's two early EPs. Not that you'd confuse We Sweat Blood for commercial-grade metal: there's very little bombast and absolutely zero hand-wringing earnestness here. The production is incredibly crisp -- instead of soaking everything in sight with reverb, most of the vocals are clean and the drums snap like whip cracks -- and the performance is very clean, with no pointless wailing from either the vocals or guitars. Everything has been stripped back to the basics: sex, Satan, and super-high volume. Sure, the lyrics are so over the top in places that it's almost like the band has become a cartoon: in the album opener, \"Forget My Name,\" \"She makes me forget my name\" is followed up by \"I wanna, I wanna, I wanna burn in Hell with you.\" Elsewhere, \"Baby I want to put some mileage on your lovebike/I want you out on the road with my testosterone make you feel alright\" is delivered with a straight face. There's even a tribute to one of fellow Canadian Neil Young's sillier lyrics. Deathless prose for the ages this ain't, but it doesn't really matter, because the groove is deep, the rock is hard, and those who aren't shaking their hips will probably be resisting the urge to follow along on the ol' air guitar. Yow.",

A follow-up EP on Sound King Records, My Love Is Bold (1999), garnered airplay on Canadian hard rock radio, setting the stage for I'm Alive and on Fire (2001), a 13-track compilation of the band's recording output from 1996 to 1999.",

Critic Steve Huey describes their music as \"uncompromising, intense, cathartic fusions of hard rock, funk, post-punk noise, and jazz experimentalism, with Rollins shouting angry, biting self-examinations and accusations over the grind.\r\n\r\nThe band have been categorized under the alternative metal, hard rock and post-hardcore genres.[8][9][10] They were part of the early 90s LA alternative metal scene, alongside bands such as Tool, Jane's Addiction, Rage Against the Machine and Green Jellÿ.[10] Their influences include 70s metal and rock bands, such as Black Sabbath, The Velvet Underground, Pink Fairies and Thin Lizzy.[8] Rollins' shout-singing style proved influential to later nu metal and alternative metal artists such as Coal Chamber, Korn, Chevelle, Godsmack and System of a Down.[8] Rollins Band have been covered by Pearl Jam.[11]",

While not as technically proficient as Iron Maiden or as heavy as Judas Priest, Saxon were one of the top metal bands of the early `80s with their brand of blue collar metal. This album is all about believing in yourself and band's love of transportation, especially motorcycles. \"Motorcycle Man\" starts out with the Harley racing down the highway before launching into a fierce attack led by Biff Byford's powerful vocals. Their zeal and passion never let up as one great anthem blends into another only slowing down a bit on the excellent mid-tempo \"747 (Strangers in the Night)\" and the melodic \"Suze Hold On\" and even those songs rock. Otherwise, \"Street Fighting Gang\", \"Freeway Mad\", \"Machine Gun\", \"See the Light Shining\", and \"Stand Up and Be Counted\" are all wicked tracks with awesome riffs from Paul Quinn and Graham Oliver and strong performances from the rhythm section of Steve Dawson and Pete Gill. The title track is their signature song, their \"Tom Sawyer\" or \"Walk This Way\" if you will, and is one of the all-time great metal anthems. This is Saxon's best album (Strong Arm of the Law is close) and if you love heavy metal, this is a must have.",

        "Description": "Die Toten Hosen are getting old. And better at their craft - the end result is a record that feels a lot more mature than their previous efforts but still retains much of the fun and hard edge of the past. This record has a fair bit of variety and while the slower songs might turn off older fans, the variety makes this record one that stays on cue much longer than you would expect one from Die Toten Hosen to be.",

            "Description": "Noted for their irreverent style and tough but hooky tunes, German punk/metal band Die Toten Hosen are one of Germany's most successful rock bands, still commanding a large and loyal following at home and in Australia, South America, and Japan more than three decades after they began. Die Toten Hosen (the name literally translates as \"the Dead Trousers\") was formed in 1982 from the ashes of two Düsseldorf punk bands, ZK and KFC. Considering that three members of the Hosen were named Andreas, they took stage names to avoid confusion: vocalist Campino (b. Andreas Frege; June 22, 1962), guitarist Breiti (b. Andreas Breitkopf; Feb. 6, 1964), rhythm guitarist Kuddel (b. Andreas Von Holst; June 11, 1964), bassist Andi (b. Andreas Meurer; July 24, 1962), and drummer Trini (b. Klaus-Dieter Trimpop; June 10, 1951). Die Toten Hosen self-released their first album, Opel Gang, in 1983, and several months later, EMI signed the group and reissued the LP. EMI soon grew disenchanted with the band (particularly after they were sued by German pop icon Heino after they parodied him in concert), and Virgin released their next album, Unter Falscher Flagge, in 1984; the following year, Trini vacated the drum stool to become the group's manager, and Wölli (b. Wolfgang Rohde; Jan. 9, 1963) took over on percussion. In 1986, the band released Damenwahl, which fared well on the charts and gave them their first taste of corporate sponsorship -- Fromms, a major condom manufacturer, helped promote the Damenwahl tour and provided samples of their products to hand out to fans. A live album followed, 1987's Bis Zum Bitteren Ende, and the group finally moved from cult favorites to a real commercial force in Germany with 1988's Ein Kleines Bisschen Horrorschau, which rose to number seven on the German charts.",
